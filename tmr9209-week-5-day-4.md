Today we just resumed our discussion of combat systems since we have
determined that our setting will be choice 2, Tronopolis. To begin the day we
looked at our top three choices from the previous week, including the combat
systems with the six elements, the one with yin/yang, and the Runescape skill
and grid base systems. After refreshing our memory and determining the
advantages/disadvantages of each system we voted and determined that Runescape
would be the best system.

The next accomplishment today was molding this game system in with the
Tronopolis setting. After some discussion we decided to change some components
of the combat system, molding it into a 2D side scroller rather than a 3D
isomorphic view. With this we believe the setting and combat system work well
together.

Finally, we ended the day by looking at questions we want to ask during our
various play testings that we will need to do on our design.
