[Amazing Turtle](https://github.com/Zanarama/AmazingTurtle) has really been
growing as a project thanks to the amazing [Tim
Duffy](https://github.com/thequbit). Amazing Turtle has expanded from just a
small set of lessons for students to learn Python using Turtle to a full
website that with a simulated Python environment with limited functionality.
Eventually the site will allow logins so that students can complete lessons,
share their work, and most importantly learn some coding! Organizations (like
a school county) will contain sub-organizations (like a school). Instructors
will be a part of schools and can create class sessions for students who are
also part of the organization to join. Right now everything is still pretty
fuzzy but take a look at a [rough
prototype](http://mycodespace.net/projects/amazingturtle/) created by Tim
Duffy.
