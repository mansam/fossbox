Well...as of right now, I seem to be having issues trying to get a picture to
show up on the main page of the site as a blog entry. I have been using my
Drupal instance for all testing purposes which you can find a link to in the
last blog post. I have also been researching more about the 960.gs (grid
system) which is a framework for CSS that allows properly structured Web pages
based on a specified number of columns.

I will try to figure out this weekend why the pictures are not showing up, and
next week, I will meet a Drupal ninja who will hopefully clear up a few things
for me and help me be more productive. This is my first time using
Druapl...there is A LOT to learn.

If anyone can help with the image issue in the meantime, that would be
tremendous!
