Today was a day of preparation. We had to have fifteen working XOs to give an
educational programming lesson tomorrow. On each of these XOs we were going to
put SkyTime, Lemonade Stand, and Amazing Turtle, a maze exercise using turtle
in python to teach young kids the fundamentals of programming. This sounds a
whole lot simpler than it was. First of all we found out that the XOs did not
have tkinter which is required to run turtle. Then when trying to get
everything to work it was discovered that the majority of the XOs on site were
have some form of mechanical problem preventing us from setting them up. While
working on this I also came up with the idea to create a graphical interface
for the Amazing Turtle project to make it easier to set up and run. However,
since our fearless leader, decause, came up with a quicker solution to setting
up Amazing Turtle for the XOs, I've set aside my idea to be worked on as a
project for my spare time so I can focus on my SURF related duties while on
duty.
