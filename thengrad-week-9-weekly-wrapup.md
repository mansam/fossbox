It is now the end of the ninth week of this summer research program. This
summer research project is beginning to fully wrap up. Badges on the XO
environment is coming along very nicely. We are very close to being able to
fully realize the goal we had with badges but due to complications with the
technology we had available to work with some of the grander ideas we had
cannot be finished within just this summer. However our goal to have something
that runs and stores open badges on the XO is well within our reach at this
point. All the work with the code that Iâ€™ve elected to take on at this point
was fully wrapped up this week. This week, with a lot of frustration, I merged
in all of the changes I had made on my own branch into the main develop
branch. There were a lot of frustrating conflicts that I had to figure out
ways to work around so that the two sets of changes could work together. Then
my time was spent preparing the equipment we needed in for the day at the camp
where we were teaching sixth graders about programming. Then after the camp I
participated in the hack-a-thon to catch up to where we needed to be on the
project.

The next week we are working on wrapping up and putting the finishing touches
on the badges and Lemonade Stand. Then we are putting together and rehearsing
our presentations showing what we have done.
