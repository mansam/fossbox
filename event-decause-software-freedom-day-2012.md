## What is Software Freedom Day?

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is a worldwide celebration of Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS). Our goal in this celebration is to educate the worldwide
public about of the benefits of using high quality FOSS in education, in
government, at home, and in business -- in short, everywhere! The non-profit
company **[Software Freedom International](/sfi) **coordinates SFD at a global
level, providing support, giveaways and a point of collaboration, but
volunteer teams around the world organize the local SFD events to impact their
own communities.

Many thanks to our [Sponsors and
Supporters](http://softwarefreedomday.org/2010/SponsorsAndSupporters) without
whom we could not make such an event happen.
