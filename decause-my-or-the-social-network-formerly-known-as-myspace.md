/me dug up his old and busted myspace, or my|_______| as it is called now.
After a bit of a facelift (+.5 for having a decent javascript-y UI) I checked
out their "Open" Developer community and RESTful API. *Almost* signed up for
an API key, but quickly rescinded when I got to that pesky Proprietary Rights
Section of the Developer Addendum... Pasted here for your amusement:

"""

MySpace retains all right, title and interest, including without limitation,
all intellectual property rights, in and to (i) the MySpace Services,
including, without limitation, the MySpace Apps Developer Platform, including,
without limitation, any and all content, look and feel, user interfaces, data
and metrics in connection therewith, and any derivative works and/or
compilations thereof or relating thereto; (ii) User Information; and (iii) any
feedback you may provide to MySpace in connection with the MySpace Apps
Developer Service (collectively, “MySpace Property”).

"""

Also, for funzies I thought "hey, it'd be cool if I linked up my campaign blog
here too", so I added an "html module" and placed it into my profile page with
links, only to find out that the URL's are completely obfuscated... so I
changed the display text to the source links to retain transparency ;)

That's more than enough myspacery for the day... now off with Jlew to put up a
ruby on rails stack, and set up a diaspora 'pod' for the fossbox... an even
more painful but much Free'er alternative. We're totally going to use their
API with a Pyramid Stack to create "PyAspora" at some point :P
