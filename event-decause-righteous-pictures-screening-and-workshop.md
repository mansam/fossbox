"The award-winning documentary filmmakers of Righteous Pictures host this
90-minute workshop. Learn how documentary filmmakers can take advantage of
Internet technologies to seek out funding and strategic partners, identify and
enlist their audience, and create outreach campaigns that both market the film
they have worked so hard to create, and allow the film to serve as a conduit
by which their audience can get actively involved in social action. The
filmmakers will show clips from their first two films, The Last Survivor and
Web, and reflect on the many challenges posed throughout the production cycle
and how they overcame them."
