Today and yesterday I got a lot of work done on the menus that will handle
magic attacks. All that's left to do is call the menu in the appropriate area
of the battle engine, and then testing. Next on the battle engine agenda are
special attacks, tallying enemy damage and a win/lose screen with item/money
deal outs. Tomorrow should be fun and full of things to do as we're taking a
trip to the strong museum for play. Apparently MAFH is on display there! We'll
also swing by a local game developer, Second Ave.
