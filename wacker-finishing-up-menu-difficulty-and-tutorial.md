Today I finished up some of our new menu features. In collaboration with the
new tutorial screen I implemented, I added text info for each window
explaining what each screens represents and what you will be doing in each
one. My hope or goal is to present the new version of the game to children and
not give any verbal instructions and have them navigate through the new
interface and explore the tutorial and learn how to play just from that. Next
task is get some kids for playtesting!
