Saturday was [Software Freedom Day!](http://softwarefreedomday.org/) The
weather was terrible but the day was awesome! We started off with a 'My first
Kernal Hack' talk in which we actually edited the kernel to fix a simple bug.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the actual submission email to work so we
never submitted the fix, but it was a nice start to kernel hacking. Plus
Matthew Whitehead may be coming to RIT more as a mentor of sorts so I may have
the opportunity to learn some more from him. I certainly hope so!

The most exciting part of SFD for me was that I began hacking with the [Beagle
Bone Black](http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black). I didn't get
the motor working within SFD but we left and went to the CAST labs and after
some intense debugging of both hardware and software we got motor running! You
can find out more about this project in my bugfix blogpost where I am going to
write about the project and the code changes that I made.
