# Ahead of and behind myself

Today was an interesting day. [FOSSmaster Decause](https://github.com/decause)
was out of the FOSSbox all day, carrying out business in Syracuse. For this
first half of the day, the ranking member of the office was
[Oddshocks](https://github.com/oddshocks), a bit of wild man, never hesitant
to speak his mind. However, later in the day
[Threebean](https://github.com/Ralphbean) came by and gave us all a
[presentation on GitFlow](http://threebean.org/presentations/gitflow/#/step-1)
- a means of organizing branches of ones repositories on GitHub.

When on the tangent on step 5, he showed us how to edit our bashrc files, so
now when I'm in a repository with uncommitted content, the color of the prompt
is red, and it contains the number of uncommitted files in the repo. Upon
learning this, I edited the config file in ~/.bashrc and made the folder name
be Blue when I wasn't in a repo. I also cleaned up the brackets so now my
terminal looks like this: `Fortnight@Kohmpyutaa etc $`. Aside from that I just
took some more notes on school-servers and held on to my work ethic.
