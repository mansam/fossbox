Summary: Yesterday was the [Election Night ... 

Yesterday was the [Election Night
Hackathon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BYV1YDCCYAALlvQ.png:large) here at RIT.
The local elections were covered and data was gathered from a few surrounding
counties. You can see the results [here](http://yacht.rit.edu/election/). The
night was pretty slow for me since it was only local elections and I am not a
NY native. I look forward to going the next presidential election in 2016.

The biggest thing I learned from the Election Night Hackathon is that most
people don't know that Election Night is ALWAYS the 1st Tuesday of November.
The number of Fossboxers that thought the Hackathon was tonight was
astonishingly high.

Other than that I hung out talking with some cool people, did some homework,
and waited for election results to pour in. I was surprised that results
didn't start posting until 8, and once they did all the data was released
rather quickly. It would be interesting if it was released more often to give
more time to watch the results.
