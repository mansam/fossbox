We spent the day mostly moving everything we had packed up on day 2 to the new
location for the FOSSBox for the summer. It was a lot of tiring working moving
all the heavy and awkward equipment. There were a few injuries during moving
but luckily there was nothing serious. There were a few stiff backs, a couple
people got minor cuts, and I ended up with splinters. However, the moving went
very smoothly. The rest of the day, us in the Lemonade Stand team went over
our ideas of what we want to work on with and split them into what we will
finish, what we will try to finish if we have time, and what we would like to
see finished in the future with one of the mentors for the project, Prof.
Jacobs.
