Blocku is a puzzle game consisting of filling a grid with squares by matching
the squares sides by following a constraint. Blocku is a game that can be used
by teachers to teach a multitude of subjects to students. The teacher will be
able to create a constraint such as match the formula to the answer or A + B =
C. Then the teacher makes a list with two columns. Each row in the columns is
a pair of of matching objects. The first row of column A matches the first row
of column B. Using this formula the game will randomly assign the objects of
each column to square blocks, one object per side. The student then has to put
all the pieces in a grid so that pairs on the sides of the squares follow the
constraint. The student will be able to move the pieces as well as rotate
them.
