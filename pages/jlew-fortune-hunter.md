Mathematical Adventure: Fortune Hunter draws on teaching children of a global
scale fourth grade mathematics through the guise of a dungeon styled adventure
game. Players will be able to explore dungeons and fight fearsome battles with
various monsters, each pertaining to a unique mathematical concept. The player
controls a protagonist that must progress through maze-like dungeons, solve
puzzles / problems, and defeat enemies in a two dimensional world. It is a
single player adventure with room for ad hoc cooperative play in the future.
