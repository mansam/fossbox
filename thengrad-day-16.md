After looking up the syntax of dictionaries in python I've come to a better
understanding of Lemonade Stand's code. I gave up trying to work on the ticket
I was assigned because there was just to much overlap that I was very
unproductive. So I've switched my focus for now to work more on the random
events that happen to the player and balancing some of them to help try and
slow down the rate the player earns money.

Today was the RocPy meet up. Most of us here for the summer went. We heard a
talk about multi-threading python code. Then team Lemonade Stand gave two
quick lightning talks, one on our current project of Lemonade Stand and one on
Skytime. Then we listened to the other groups here for the summer give
lightning talks on the projects they were working on.
