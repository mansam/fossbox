Today we continued the process of flushing out our presentation. Since we
completed analyzing the play testing data on Friday, this was the only thing
left to focus on. Although this is the last accomplishment we will complete
before the Symposium, there was still a lot of work to be accomplished. We
went through the presentation and flushed out several more slides. Finally, we
practiced presenting and editing the presentation to get it down to the
required 10 minutes to give time to David for the technology demo and to give
time for questions and answers.

In the afternoon we also retested Adobe to make sure that the technology would
work during our presentation. Since my laptop will be the backup device, I had
to be there and make sure my computer worked with the presentation rooms
computer and devices.
