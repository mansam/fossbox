Summary: Today started out with a round of meetings and some time at POSSE. In the middle of all this, I got my first glimpse at the actual code for CIVX... exciting! With help from Luke, I edited the tabs demo to get bill information from the senate API, replacing the hard-coded text. The JSON data for bills by senator is strangely inconsistent depending on how the number of results per page, so I hope to figure that out soon. In any case, it makes the widget look that much more slick. :)   ...
