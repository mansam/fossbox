The goal of this project has been to research and plan a game which promotes
and rewards FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) development. However, this
goal is no easy task since game design alone provides intense challenges to
provide a fun and balanced experience. Adding on FOSS development stats makes
game design much harder, adding imbalance and other issues. On top of all of
this, we have been going in alone, researching this new topic that has not
been looked into before.

To accomplish such a goal our team has put substantial research into the
subject. We have answered crucial questions specific to our goal, necessary
information to develop a game around, researched FOSS software necessary to
create the game, and looked into the issues we will face when integrating the
FOSS data. With this initial research we moved onto actually developing a game
around all of this massive compilation of data. We decided that the game
should be a 2D RPG game. We also decided things like the setting, story,
combat, and world. Finally, we flushed out the rest of what needed to be
thought of for implementing a game, including what the FOSS data would do and
allow for within the game. With this information we have been able to make a
game Treatment document and a High concept document, both of which could be
used with our other documents to create the game.

With our game design complete we have recently gone into the testing stage
with balancing and play testing. Through this period we hope to look deeper
into our design, find imbalances, and fix potential issues within the game to
make our design solid. To accomplish this we have developed paper prototypes,
with which volunteers will give us feedback.
