Summary: This week was, again, a whirlwind of experiences. Leading the charge on this battle, we were able to take Monday off because we all went to the National Civic Day of Hacking. Beginning on Tuesday, we had a short seminar on getting set up on [GitHUB](https://github.com/) to learn how to use Git.

This week was, again, a whirlwind of experiences. Leading the charge on this
battle, we were able to take Monday off because we all went to the National
Civic Day of Hacking. Beginning on Tuesday, we had a short seminar on getting
set up on [GitHUB](https://github.com/) to learn how to use Git. We also
started our planning for our trip to a local school for Lemonade Day, by
planning I mean we started talking about what would be good to bring and how
we were going to get there.

Moving into our rather dismal Wednesday, this was the day that mentally
exhausted everyone who was searching for information. We embarked on our
extended journey to find some sort of reference for information regarding
school servers. Little did we know that this journey would take the rest of
the day, as well as refuse to yield any results...As a last effort, I emailed
the FOSSbox friend Walter Bender, to see if he could help point us into the
right direction. He gave us a list of people to ping in IRC channel for some
info. Within the #sugar channel we found a dev who pointed us toward another
channel #schoolserver. Within this paradise of informaiton known as
#schoolserver, we met a guide by the handle of "Aklis" . This particular dev
knew a ton of information regarding the school servers that we need to work
with. We talked to him for awhile getting a couple urls that will definitely
help us:

[ School Server
Documentation](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3)

[Journal Backup Reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20101103030824/http://wi
ki.paraguayeduca.org/index.php/Analisis_de_Uso_de_Actividades<br />

)

[Journal Back Up Source code](http://web.archive.org/liveweb/http://git.paragu
ayeduca.org/gitweb/users/rgs/xs-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/get-journal-
stats.py?js=1<br />

)

These are the first urls in a long line of information trail blazing. We'll
keep this updated as we keep searching and finding answers to our questions.

The next rather big thing on the plate was that we attended a local school in
supporting Lemonade Day. We brought a couple XO laptops installed with Skytime
and Lemonade Stand for young students to playtest while we went and gorged
ourselves on lemonade. It was an awesome time, partly because the kids were
amazing sales people with great lemonade and cookies and 50% of the proceeds
went to a charitable cause!

That about wraps up week 2, stay tuned for week 3 posts!
