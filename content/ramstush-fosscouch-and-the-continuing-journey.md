Yesterday was a bittersweet day for everyone at the FOSSbox at RIT...We all
had the solemn duty of packing away all materials and equipment in the box to
be moved to a new temporary FOSSlab so Innovation Center renovations can
commence. With all the help we had, the proceedings moved quickly and
smoothly.

After a delicious lunch, the team sat down and tackled the task of dividing
our list of features/tasks/needs/nices/wishes/ etc. We used the previous
team's wiki page to start [Lemonade Stand
Wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand), then we moved on to adding
our own ideas and prioritizing them according to a quick run down of Miamoto's
pyramid. Finishing our debrief early, we were enabled to leave early and soak
up as many rays as we wanted.

PREPARE FOR THE FOSSbox EXODUS!!
