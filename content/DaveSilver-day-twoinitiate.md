So it is 10 AM the second day of the quarter and I am getting ready to start
working. Last night I took the time to recreate all of the Fortune Hunter
images in 9 unique formats which included, 3 different types of BMPs, GIFs,
PNGs, and 4 different levels of quality of JPEGs. While I did that, JT setup
the XO laptop so that he and I could look at the system stats while we test
each type of image. So that's what we are doing today, running tests to
determine what works best as an image format on the XO for load times and
stuff like that. Have a great day.
