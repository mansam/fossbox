Today we started off by review Git and Github. I reviewed what I had learned
from week 1 and made sure that I understood it all. After doing this the group
took the game technologies with the highest ratings from yesterday. Using
these games we created a Community Architecture thoughts document to go into
more detail about each of them. We looked at each repository for activity,
looked deeper into what each technology was about, and looked into the
history/contributions that was behind each technology. Using this information,
we compiled it and some of the other information for the past week into a
presentation for SJ tomorrow so that we can get new direction on how to
proceed.
