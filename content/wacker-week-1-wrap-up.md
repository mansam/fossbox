The first week working with the FOSSbox was already quite the experience. I
have learned numerous things for a smart bunch of individuals and it is was
only week 1!

I have learned how to work with the Linux OS and set that up on my laptop (see
you later Windows) and I have already fallen in love with it! I set up my very
own [GitHub](https://github.com/wackerFOSS) account where I will be posting
all my work that I have done this summer as well in the future.

After getting some hands on experience with Fedora, I was able to installed
Sugar on my laptop which allows me to switch between the Sugar and Fedora
environments to test Lemonade Stand, the project I am working on this summer,
as if I was playing it on the XO. Once set up, my team and I playtested
[Lemonade Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) for about a hour
to get an idea and a feel for how the game played and any potential features
we would like to teak, improve, or add. Our primary goal is hocking up
[Mozilla Open Badges](http://www.openbadges.org/) to the game so we will be
able to award badges for accomplishments within not only Lemonade Stand, but
hopefully any XO game. After playtesting came our first brainstorm of things
we would like to do to the game. We threw down any comment or idea that arose
into a spreadsheet to keep an active list.

This brings us to the doomsday, packing up the FOSSbox :( Nobody wanted to
pack up or move the location of the FOSSbox, but we were not in control of
that. We successfully organized and cleaned up everything that we wanted to to
make the next day, moving day, as easy and fluid as possible. After everything
was moved to our new location, this is when we took a look at our list of
ideas and began to prioritize them. We worked with Professor Stephen Jacobs to
help group our ideas from must haves, to things that would be nice, to things
that would wish or want to do. I am began to work on the new Lemonade Stand
structure diagram which will be finished within the next week.

After moving came the [Civic Hackathon!](http://hackforchange.org/) I was not
able to physically be there, as my younger sister was graduating high school,
but I was able to work remotely and join in on the [Sky-
Time](http://www.playskytime.com/) project and hack away on it! I quickly
picked up the project and began adding some improvements that the team and I
came up with. I will be posting more about this in the week to come as I will
continue to hack away at it until Friday when we plan on releasing the
improved version!

I am very happy with my first week and cannot be more excited for the upcoming
weeks and what I will be doing to help change lives around the world working
with [FOSS@RIT](http://foss.rit.edu/) as well as bright and intelligent
individuals!

Also, as I was travelling home for my sister's graduation, I caught a quick
picture of a familiar sight ;)
