It is now the end of the eigth week of this summer research program. Things
are moving very fast here this summer. In only a couple weeks we are going to
have to present on the research we have done. The game Lemonade Stand is
looking great. All the new features and fixing up and fully implementing of
all the features the previous teams had planned for Lemonade are finishing up
nicely. The badges research is coming along as well. It isn’t quite finished
yet but it does look like we might be able to have it finished for the end of
the program. However due to complications it won’t work the same way we had
originally planned it. What I’ve done this week was wrap up everything that
I’ve been working on. Which after looking back at everything I’ve done, the
work I’ve put into Lemonade Stand has mostly been to make the game more secure
and less likely to cause errors when adding in new features, modifying and
testing existing features, or making variations of stands other than for
lemonade. Lemonade Stand before I did anything this week had a lot of places
where people making changes would have to make sure that they also would have
to go through and make sure very specific information was also changed. In
places that were less obvious and that allowed for generic default values for
I added in safety nets so the code wouldn’t just error and break. So for
example if an ingredient was modified or removed but the events or the list of
starting values for the player’s inventory weren’t changed I had the program
correct the mistakes for that instance. I also spent the week trying to merge
all my changes into the develop branch so that I could finish up all my
tickets on the code and start working on the presentations.

With that being said, what I plan on working on for the weeks to come is to
fix the error I got from merging, then work on the presentation and paper on
the results of research for the summer, though I’m not sure if things will go
like I planned for the next week because they haven’t yet.
