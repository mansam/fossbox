The Gist

This chapter details the how open source projects are developed from
contributing to collaborating to decision making. It focused a lot on the
Linux kernel and how it developed from having just Linus Torvalds contributing
to having a large user/contributor base. The chapter also explores FOSS
software from an economic and social perspective often forgotten.

The Good

- Breaking gender stereotypes "The fairy tale solution would be to place a brilliant young eccentric in an isolated basement room with a computer and lots of coffee and let her write software until the point of exhaustion." (59)

- The metaphors were really interesting, especially comparing looking at the process of creating Ford cars and the process of making software

- It wasn't preachy, that is, it didn't detail why you should always use FOSS things and why FOSS is better than anything else.

- The discussion of of the T-shirts for contributing to projects reminds me a lot of [Fedora Badges](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/) and the idea of motivating involvement through recognition

The Bad

- Very long....I was not expecting it to be 40 pages

- Some statements were absolutes about groups of people and probably overstatments.

- Assumes a base level of knowledge about subjects that can leave the reader a little lost

The Questions

- How accurate are the statistics about how much code is written in-house, for in-house and not sold or distributed? I would like to see how that has changed.

- How has the voting/deciding on the code direction of a project changed? As the user/contributor case has grown, I am unsure if the voting systems discussed have gone unchanged.

- How often does a fork become more popular than the orgin? How often does it branch off into something else entirely?

The Review

3/5 ***

This chapter provides an intesting insight into the growth and into the
development and philosophy of FOSS. Its an interesting read for those with a
general familiarity with FOSS or software development. It may be offputing to
a newcomer with no experience with the subject. The information is also a bit
outdated, and could use an update. Overall, I would recommend it, but you may
need to do some extra research on your own while reading.
