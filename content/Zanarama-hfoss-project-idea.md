A huge part of the project for the HFOSS course is creating a
game/application/contribution to Sugar Labs projects. As I am not a game
design student I proposed a project that will take a little bit of a different
path that would include hardware, my interest (and stronger suit).

The XO laptops can interface with [these
sensors](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Peripherals/Sensors) or, with a modified
XO, a serial port. We are hoping to use these sensors to build off of the
[Measurement Activity](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Measure) to build a
WeatherStation activity of some sort.

Realistically, we would like to use the hummidity sensor, and temperature
sensor and build an activity to measure these and graph them. As a stretch
goal, it would be nice if the student had to place the datapoint themselves to
teach graphing skills.

For now our ideas are a little vague, but the team will be Rob Clifford, Chis
Cordi, Greg Ekstrom, and myself. We will be reaching out to Walter Bender on
IRC to see if he will mentor us for this project since he gave us sensors
already, and the FOSSBox has a good relationship with him.
