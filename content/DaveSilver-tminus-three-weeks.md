So we officially have only three weeks left to finish this project. That seems
like a small amount but I think we are pretty much on track for that. Last
week we discovered that using the images object type was a bad idea and
decided we needed to convert our system to using sprites. Thankfully this does
not require too much hard work on our end. I am currently working towards this
goal.

Today my goal is to make a custom sprite group for updating sprites and stuff.
This will allow us to work with our new sprite objects in a group format. I do
not know how long this will take but hopefully we will be done by the end of
the day. Talk to you all later.
