Greece just scored its second ever goal in the World Cup; thanks to RIT's
impressive hospitality I enjoyed watching this historical event happen on a
screen taller than myself while sitting ten feet away.

Today begins the production of the last test before we the art team move into
animation territory; I'm running benchmarks on how quickly the system responds
when loading sprites with pygame to compare the information to our tests of a
similar type where we used pygame's image class.

Exciting times, made only better with the constant pretend anguish of life-
sized soccer players on the wall in front of me.
