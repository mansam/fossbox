After setting up Fedora on my laptop and completely throwing away Windows, I
have installed Sugar as well as Lemonade Stand, the game I will be working on
for the remainder of my time this summer!

This was very exciting to finally get some hands on interaction with the game
and see how it plays out. I went through and playtested the game for a hour
writing down ideas, thoughts, or any comments about the game that could
potentially be improved or implemented. Ideas that came to mind were being
able to create your own recipe and prices as well as having different
locations the player could travel between to attract more costumers.

Along with all the ideas, I began to think of badges that could be created as
our primary goal this summer is to implement Open Badges into Lemonade Stand.
One badge being reach a certain amount of money in a certain time frame. More
badges will be discussed later once we collaborate all of our results from the
day!

I also made my first million in the game in less than a third of a year!
