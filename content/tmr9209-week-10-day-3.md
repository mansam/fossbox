Today we finished the presentation for the Symposium and prepared for the trip
tomorrow. The first stage was revising the presentation based on SJ's review
on the previous day. We also had to add several slides for David and his
technology demo, which has also been completed. Finally, we practiced
presenting again with this edited presentation.

In addition to the Symposium presentation, we also had modify it for the
larger presentation to Red Hat. I liked adding to this presentation since it
contained most of the game systems, balancing, and play testing which was not
included in the Symposium presentation.

Once we knew that the presentations were complete, we took them down from
Google documents and had Francis convert them to the Fedora presentation
template to give the presentations an aesthetic feel. With this complete all
that remains is the presentations for Friday, off to Boston tomorrow!
