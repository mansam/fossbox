Yesterday, while becoming increasingly frustrated at the NY senate's website
as I tried to scrape committee information, Nate suggested a much easier
solution. I had been attempting to visit each senator's page and get their
committees individually, but naturally, the website is formatted so
inconsistently that no two senators list their committees in the same place or
manner. I whiled away a number of hours in this direction before Nate had the
idea of searching from the other direction - visiting each committee page and
getting its members.

I got a good start on this track yesterday, but had to leave shortly after.
Luckily, now that I'm not wrangling an enormous regular expression this should
go much faster. Once we have a list of committees for each person, getting
their meetings/votes is a matter of a couple loops and should be done in no
time. And that will amount to the completion of this widget, at long last!
