So my blog post is a little late today but better late than never right?
Anyway so I have been working on my test environment for the different Sprite
Sheet styles and I just got it displaying one of the types perfectly. So now I
am just working towards getting the implementation of the other types. Once
they are all implemented I will begin doing tests on them to make sure they
work as intended. Once they all work, I will setup the main test so that
(hopefully) tomorrow I can start actual benchmarking tests. I shall post more
soon, and have a great day.
