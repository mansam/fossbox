******Capitol Camp 2011 is an “unconference” and Developer’s Summit taking place October 20th and 21st that brings together government technology stakeholders under the roof of the New York State Capitol Building to share challenges and solutions. We hope to build on the success of prior Capitol Camp events to further engage and expand this community, as a key component of leveraging technology to build a more transparent, efficient, and participatory government for all New York State citizens.******

_Capitol Camp 2011 is organized and hosted by the New York State Senate and
the New York State Office of the Chief Information Officer/Office for
Technology (CIO/OFT) in collaboration with the Center for Technology in
Government and Reinvent Albany._

Capitol Camp 2011 spans two days: a “Developer’s Summit” for programmers on
Thursday, October 20; and an “unconference” targeting a wider audience of both
technical and non-technical participants on Friday, October 21. Both events
are held in the Legislative Office Building, in Albany, from 10:00am to
5:00pm, with a break for lunch. Participants can purchase lunch at nearby
restaurants and cafeterias.

_**Thursday, October 20th**_: The Developer’s Summit, primarily for
programmers, is a day-long conversation about coding, collaborative software
development and best practices. The conversation will involve hands-on work in
open-source applications currently used in New York State Government.

_**Friday, October 21st**_: The main “unconference” will consist of higher
level, less technical, interactive sessions that examine the intersection of
government and technology. Additionally, the New York State Office of the
Chief Information Officer/Office for Technology (CIO/OFT) will also announce
the Empire 2.0 Showcase Agency Award.

Both days will be framed within the context of three thematic tracks. Event
participants will select specific session topics within each track on the day
of each event. Visit the[ CapCamp2011 Wiki](http://barcamp.org/CapCamp2011) –

Wiki](http://barcamp.org/CapCamp2011).  Please contact Dean Hill
([dhill@nysenate.gov](mailto:dhill@nysenate.gov)) to propose a session.

****_2) E-Government Services_**** - This track will examine how government entities use technology to provide services to the public today, challenges faced (technical, political, and policy-based) during the implementation of services, as well as opportunities for the development of new and innovative service delivery mechanisms.

******_3) _********_Gov 2.0 Enabling Technologies_**** **- This track will focus on the underlying technologies and tools that government can (or could) use to more effectively interface with the public. Examples include open source software, mobile applications, and cloud computing.
