Summary: It is now the end of the fourth week of this summer research program. This was a week full of interesting events. This was the first week with the full summer crew present all week. There was a power outage on Monday that made only some of us loose power, disrupting work for a few hours.

It is now the end of the fourth week of this summer research program. This was
a week full of interesting events. This was the first week with the full
summer crew present all week. There was a power outage on Monday that made
only some of us loose power, disrupting work for a few hours. Then on
Wednesday, the boat went down causing trouble with the meeting logs and many
of us from writing the blog posts on time.

As for what I did this week, I found that because there was a lot of overlap
on the ticket I was working on and the ticket another member of the summer
research program was working on that I was often finding myself with not much
to work on. So I gave the rest of my ticket to him and moved on to another
ticket. I was trying to make the game a little more balanced so that players
didn't find themselves earning over a million dollars profit a day in Lemonade
Stand within only a few days. I was doing this by specifically working on how
the game would choose the random events and making the negative random events
a little more potent.

I’m fairly close to finishing this ticket. I need to play test my changes to
fine-tune them so that it is hard but still playable on the hardest difficulty
and to add more events with the advice of the rest of the team. After that
I’ll be choosing a new ticket to start working for the rest of next week.
