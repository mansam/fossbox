Today was finishing up a lot of odds and ends. We started off by completing
the Symposium script and powerpoint. With this completed we will be in a
pretty good position, since the Boston trip is next weekend. Next week all we
will need to do is polish the presentation with practice and edits.

We also finished preparations for the play test which will take place tonight.
The play test has been polished, the papers have been printed out, and the
materials have been gathered. Finally, we accomplished a little more
organization of our documents so that anyone reading our documents can
understand our research and design.
