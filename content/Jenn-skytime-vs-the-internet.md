Summary: Howdy, ... 

Howdy,

Today I laid out some pages that I plan to print out for the White House.
(Once approved by the important people :D)

I also emailed with Mizmo the badges I have created for Fedora. I think a lot
of them will be put in place before FLOCK, and many will be awarded by then. I
will have finish up the last two 10 Bulls badges to complete the set.

I found this news clip abut SkyTime:

I just stumbled upon it on the internet; no one had sent it to me or anythingâ€¦
I am super curious about who was in contact with the news! Regardless, it is
super cool to see a project of mine on the news!

Also if I have not posted it:

SkyTime is getting some really cool internet media, soon I will have to make a
news page on the website :D
