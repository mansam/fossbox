Today was a productive day!

I made a bunch of phone calls about printing decals for SJ’s new bike, and got
the logo files almost complete for printing. I am currently working on a new
logo for mobile zone. It still needs work but I attached my first go at it. I
think I got a decent start…

I committed a bunch of Lemonade-Stand Files for DAWacker to start
implementing. I will have a bunch more for him tomorrow. (My Birthday btw :D
21 woot)

I also improve on the software freedom day flier. Looking a lot nicer now. As
it gets closer I will just add the specific info and it will be good to print!

I found a whole bunch of articles online about SkyTime! Googleing myself has
become quite fun!

Gotta run! :D
