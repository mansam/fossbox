Today was no artwork, and a lot of preparation Washington DC. Running around,
picking things up, and discussing printing… nothing too exciting to show. SJ
has the very interesting idea that we should give Obama a few copies of our
Hagaddah since he is the first president to celebrate Passover in the White

Next week I plan to be super productive, including getting the printing
process started for the stickers for the labs new bike, more badges and assets
for lemonade stand. I’ll also be purchasing a fancy business suit. :)

Looking at SkyTime today I think I want to revise the UI a bit. (Which I

and we can have a group discussion about if it is worth It later.

Have a nice weekend :D
