So today I finally finished all of the classes and functions of the animation
system. My next task is to integrate all of the classes into the game engine
that Jlew and BlitzKev have built. This task is pretty hefty and will probably
take a day or so to complete. It involves me finding every location where my
stuff would be used and then figuring how best to make it work in those
locations. It's a big task but I know I am up to it.

On top of integrating our system into the game engine I also have to create
graphics for Lemonade Stand. Lemonade Stand is another game that was made
using the engine. I probably won't spend more than a day on the graphics so
hopefully they will be good but who knows. Anyway that's what's happening with
me now. Have a good day.
