Hi,

My name’s Jenn, and I am the new kid at FOSS@RIT. I am really excited to be
the artist/designer to be working here!!

I am studying Medical Illustration at RIT, and when I am not drawing organs in
the cadaver lab, I have been getting into interactive media and game design.

My first order of business at FOSS was attending a Random Hacks of Kindness
hack-a-thon. It was the first I had heard of the organization, and honestly I
was blown away by what they do.

When you think of helping a charity, what is the first thing that comes to
mind? Money. They always want money. But not everyone has money to give, and
not every situation can be helped by throwing money at it.

But what about technical skills? Couldn't that problem be easily solved by a
computer application? Yes it can. Within 3 hours of the Hack-a-thon starting,
already two guys had created a working program that was needed by the Peace
Corps. It was like watching problems being solved before my very eyes. It was
just so cool!

Here are some of the things I worked on:
