Summary: Last Tuesday was RocPy so the FOSSBox + FOSSClass took a trip to U of R. I really enjoy going to RocPy because the people and the community are really cool, but I don't feel I am getting a lot out of RocPy recently.

Last Tuesday was RocPy so the FOSSBox + FOSSClass took a trip to U of R. I
really enjoy going to RocPy because the people and the community are really
cool, but I don't feel I am getting a lot out of RocPy recently.

The subject matter is way over my head, and I barely understand the first few
minutes of the lecture, let alone the deeper Pythoning. I would really enjoy
if RocPy split the meetings into multiple smaller talks with some being very
introductory, some being midlevel skills, and some being high level mastery.

I think that this format would be more welcoming the newcomers. As it is right
now, I don't see almost anyone from the FOSS class continuing to attend RocPy,
and that is a shame.

For me, this was my last RocPy for a while. The next one is going to be during
finals week so I don't think I will be attending. After that I will be on co-
op and there is no chance of driving up to attend from Erie. Perhaps there is
a Python group there that I can go to. That might be a cool idea.
