Today has been mainly devoted to preparing for the play test. First, we
finalized the playtest, which will be taking place on Thursday 6-8pm. In
addition to this we completed the flier with the information for the event,
posting them across campus and to this FOSS@RIT website in the events section.
I also linked my informational blog post to the events page.

Beyond preparing for the play test, we also went through several of our
documents, organizing our information, moving old information into a section,
and improving our documents so that anyone can more easily understand them.
Finally, we got a head start on our outline for the Symposium presentation.
With today's accomplishment I believe we are in a good position to bring the
research to a close and to complete our goals.
