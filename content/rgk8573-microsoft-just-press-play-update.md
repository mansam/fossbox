Hello all. Below I have included a list of links based on my research on how
to accomplish this goal. Up until this point, I have started uploading and
installing Drupal and Wordpress on my own domain, and the HTML5 Boilerplate on
my people.rit.edu server account. I will supply these links once the default
sites are up. Based on the resources below, I am going to test out the Disqus
plugin for Drupal and the Roots theme for Wordpress first.

***** More resources may be added as testing unfolds *****

**Examples of real-time sites:**

  * [Slickdeals Live](http://slickdeals.net/live/) - Real-time deal posts including rankings for products and user comments
  * [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) - must press the play button at the top to see it in action
  * [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) - Basically Facebook, with real-time chat for photos and other content

**Possible options for implementation:**

  * [Openshift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/) - Suggested by Remy
  * [Strophe.js - An XMPP library for JavaScript](http://strophe.im/strophejs/)
    * [Strophe.js Plugins](https://github.com/metajack/strophejs-plugins) - not sure any of these will work
  * [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/)

**(RANK 1 - because Drupal is familiar to RIT already) Disqus:**

    * [Disqus Install Options](http://disqus.com/admin/install/)
    * [Drupal Plugin](http://disqus.com/admin/drupal/)

**(RANK 2 - I am familiar with WordPress already and this theme uses HTML5 Boilerplate and 960.gs )**

    * [WordPress Theme based on 960.gs](http://www.rootstheme.com/ )

**(RANK 3 - Might be an interesting option)**

    * [TIDEinteracive](http://tideinteractive.com/2011/05/html5-boilerplate-960-gs-tide-interactive-html5-960/)

**Books with possibly valuable information:**

    * [Professional XMPP Programming with JavaScript and jQuery](http://professionalxmpp.com/)
