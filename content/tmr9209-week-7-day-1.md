We began by looking at the what was required of us for the the Symposium
presentation within a few weeks. After finding out that we need to do an
abstract, we went on to flush out very concise paragraphs on what we have been
researching this summer. After accomplishing this we moved on to finalize our
attack prototypes and take another look over our Treatment document, which are
both pretty much finalized. David also made some progress on the technologies
research for the treatment document as well. Tomorrow we will try to get Remy
and SJ to look over the treatment document while we start to actually run
through our tabletop simulation prototype.
