Summary: So it is the beginning of week 5 which means we are almost halfway done with the summer and with this research. So this week is pretty eventful for us at the Fossbox. First we got off yesterday because it was the day after the 4th of July. Then today we have a normal day of work and then tomorrow we are all going to Boston for a Hackfest at OLPC headquarters on Thursday. We will be commuting to the Hackfest on Wednesday and coming home from it on Friday so both of those days are pretty much shot ... 

So it is the beginning of week 5 which means we are almost halfway done with
the summer and with this research. So this week is pretty eventful for us at
the Fossbox. First we got off yesterday because it was the day after the 4th
of July. Then today we have a normal day of work and then tomorrow we are all
going to Boston for a Hackfest at OLPC headquarters on Thursday. We will be
commuting to the Hackfest on Wednesday and coming home from it on Friday so
both of those days are pretty much shot as far as productivity goes.

Despite losing three days of work this week though, we should be doing a lot
of great stuff today and Thursday. Today we are working on planning the final
version of the Animation system. This means we will be determining everything
we want it to do and how we want it to do those things. So we will probably be
making a class diagram and a whole bunch of other stuff. We also plan on
pseudo-coding a lot of the classes this week so that when we start actually
making the code we know exactly what we are doing. Before we start planning we
have one or two more tests to run to make sure about some last details. Those
tests will probably be finished by 2:00 and then we will be good to go on the
planning stages of the animation system.

Hopefully this week will be decently productive but anything can happen. Well
I will be blogging more tomorrow and the rest of the week to talk about the
Hackfest and how successful it is. Have a great week.
