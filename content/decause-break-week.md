Summary: Right before winter break began, we decided to go out with a bang. We hosted a hackathon for the [STEM Video Game Challenge](http://stemchallenge.org). We had about 2 dozen attendees over the course of the evening, and had about 3 prototype and concept projects go into development by the end.  I don't want to steal my own thunder, as I will be contributing a blog post for the STEMChallenge.org blog describing the event in detail, but it is still worth mentioning.

Right before winter break began, we decided to go out with a bang. We hosted a
hackathon for the [STEM Video Game Challenge](http://stemchallenge.org). We
had about 2 dozen attendees over the course of the evening, and had about 3
prototype and concept projects go into development by the end.

I don't want to steal my own thunder, as I will be contributing a blog post
for the STEMChallenge.org blog describing the event in detail, but it is still
worth mentioning. Thanks everyone who could make it out for our 2011
Hackathon. If you missed it, don't fret, we'll be holding another one during
the new year (most likely February 2nd).

Outside of that, I have 2 bits of repo related news:

  * One: I got my bug fix patch accepted into twython
  * Two: I discovered [CoderWall](http://coderwall.com)

Coderwall is an awesome service that connects to your social media channels,
but most importantly, your accounts on open code forges, and assigns you
badges! It's pretty righteous, and the account integration is seamless. In
mentioning it to other foss folk, I was pointed at yet another awesome project
from our friends at [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org) called the [Open Badges
Project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges). You can read more about it on the
[About page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges/About), but in a few words, it
aims to "make it easy to issue, display, and manage badges across the web--
opening new ways to show your skills and achievements to the world."

Over the holidays I will be cranking on a number of work related tasks, so not
much of a break for me, but you know what they say, no rest for the wicked and
all. Wish me luck.
