My name is Ryan Stush and I am a rising senior at the Rochester Institute of
Technology studying New Media Interactive Development. I recently took a FOSS
class and was able to obtain a Co-Op with the RIT FOSS Box this summer. My
team and I will be working on implementing the Mozilla Open Badges into the
Sugar Labs XO laptops from their "One Laptop Per Child" program.

The first reason I wanted to do FOSS this summer is because I needed a Co-Op,
however after I had completed the FOSS class in which my team built a new
Sugar activity from scratch, I am exceptionally excited about working with
open source because of how the ideals of community and teamwork is central to
its mission.

Before the end of the summer, I hope to have at least a proficiency with how
to use linux, a stronger grasp of the Python language, and to network with the
amazing individuals with whom I will be working.
