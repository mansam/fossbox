I am well on the way to understanding how Drupal works and now I have an
alumni Drupal ninja, Mark DeMayo, helping me out.

So far, I have set up most of the Drupal modules and administrative stuff on
the back-end of the site. Remy has just informed me that I will be able to
migrate my site soon to RIT's servers which might make administration easier
(I hope).

Regarding the aesthetics of the site, I have been successful in creating a 3x3
grid view of comments and blog posts. I'm still trying to get this to display
properly for the site itself, but it works in my administrative preview just
fine. I have also installed a module for rating comments on a 5 star scale.
This will help me in the future with moving comments around on the page based
on popularity.

Speaking of rating and popularity, Mark and I figured we will be able to use
jQuery for this function and you will be able to see this happen on the page
making it very sticky.
