# BarCamp Rochester

### Rochester's Geek Unconference

BarCamp Rochester is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for

people to share and learn in an open environment. BarCamp Rochester

is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from

attendees. All attendees should give a demo, a session, or help

with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen.

Prepare in advance, but come early to get a good slot on the

schedule. Check-in begins around 8am, with the first presentations

starting at 9am!
