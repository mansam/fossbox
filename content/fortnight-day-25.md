# Merry Christmas!

Today it is not christmas, but it is day 25 of the Summer Undergraduate
Research Fellowship, and of my time in the FOSSbox. For some reason though,
whenever I hear the number 25 in accordance with calendars and/or day
tracking, my first thought is of Christmas. Regardless, for this week I will
take a much needed break from [slamming my head against the
wall](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lskru2nJ0u1qd7bw2o1_500.gif) for
school servers, so to speak. Today [LMacken](https://github.com/lmacken) joins
us in the FOSSbox for the week. As I mentioned on [Day
24,](http://foss.rit.edu/node/546) Hackin with LMacken would start today, and
[FOSSmaster Decause](https://github.com/decause) want us all doing hacking
tasks we can all charge on and crush underfoot.

My task for the week will be getting the [Get
Text](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Gettext) feature of the XO laptops to work
with [Lemonade Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand), and in
doing such creating a Spanish version of the game. I present to you, [El
Puesto de Limonada!](http://ecx.images-
amazon.com/images/I/51MHzc%2B6XML._SY300_.jpg) Coming soon to a free download
near you!
