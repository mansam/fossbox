Wikiotics is a community site for collaborative language instruction. The site
aims to provide easy tools for teachers and students to create high quality
language lessons that are immersion focused, interactive, and easy to share.
These activities are supported by the Wikiotics Foundation, an independent
501(c)3 non-profit. Starting in September 2010 two RIT students, Nate Case and
Taylor Rose began contributing to the project through the FOSS@RIT movement.
