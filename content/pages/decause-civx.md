CIVX is a open source public data aggregation framework that focuses on
government transparency and transitioning raw data into open and index-able
formats. Our core platform is designed to simplify the process of modeling,
scraping, scrubbing, correlating, and visualizing raw data.

This tour is intended to point out the types of information that CIVX
aggregates as well as the nuance of the interface, please feel free to contact
us with any questions.
