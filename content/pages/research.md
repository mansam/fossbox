Title: Research

We generally do applied research in this program. Research projects can really come from anyplace, faculty staff or students involved in FOSS@RIT, elsewhere from RIT affiliated folks or from external for-profits and non-profits. Some begin as class or independent study study projects for student credit, the OLPC educational games and Transbot are good examples of this. Some have begun in, or been continued as, Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Projects, the Pygame engine improvements, enhancements to CIVX and others are good examples of there. Some are directed, sponsored projects such as open video chat. Laslty some come from our own experiences in the Open SOurce development world, like the remixerator.
