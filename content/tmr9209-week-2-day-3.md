Today we completed our questions for the game that we play tested the previous
two days. In addition to this we finalized the Game Analysis document and
organized it so that it is ready for completion. Above and beyond this we
started and finished our Master Matrix spreadsheet, which can be looked at to
grasp a quick overview of the Game Analysis document. With these things
completed I believe we are in a good position to start planning out our own
game and how we plan to create it within the next two days.
