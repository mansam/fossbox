In the spirit of FooCamp, BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire
for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event
with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. All attendees must
give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the
day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall.
Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of
their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those
who can't be present. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire
to learn is welcome and invited to join. Venture over to the BarcampRochester
