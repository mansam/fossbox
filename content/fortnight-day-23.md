# A Discovery!!!!!!!!!

So today I talked with veteran [FOSSboxer
Qalthos](https://github.com/qalthos), code wizard. Though he wasn't in the
FOSSbox this week until today, he's been working on school server stuff as
well. Previously, while I've been making a fool of myself, he set up a school
server on a virtual machine on his laptop, only to have it be unpingable. Then
he set one up on some virtual space on "the boat," an intense server watched
over by Computer Science House. I had often confused this server with one we
had in the FOSSbox called "the yacht," which houses our irc accounts, because
after all, a [yacht is a kind of
boat](http://www.charteryachtparadigm.com/images/yacht-paradigm-slide_3.jpg).
However, the boat sank, and by that I mean due to extreme heat and/or having
to process a school server, the server "the boat" crashed, which I mentioned
in [my last week in review](http://foss.rit.edu/node/525).

I asked him about how he did all of that, and it turns out he used [the 0.7
version of the XS](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XS_Installing_Software), which
prompted me to go to the wiki about it. (If you want to go there, just click
the previous link.) As you can see in the right of the page, there is a table,
and on this table, there is a section for servers, the last stable version of
which was the 0.7 version, not the XSCE 0.3 edition which is the latest
unstable version. Upon seeing this I came to the conclusion that I had been
using the wrong version all along. whether the other edition worked better or
not was really up to how they define "stable." If it means "working" I should
try it out myself, but if it means ["able to support large weights, like that
of an elephant"](http://www.srichinmoybio.co.uk/weightlifting/images/sri_chinm
oy_baby_elephant_lifts.jpg) then I have no idea what is going on. Regardless
I'll install it and try it out tomorrow.
