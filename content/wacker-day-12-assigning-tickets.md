We got around to assigning team roles as well as milestone 1 tickets to
people. As for me, I will be assuming the Tech lead role in the group. My
responsibilities include working on both ends of the project, the game
development as well as the open badges integration. I will be focusing on
creating a bridge between the two.

For tickets, I was assigned with working on UI cleanup and creating a new
screen for the profit guessing mini game that the kids must complete. We threw
together some ideas and a mock up on a white board of ideas for the new mini
game screen.
