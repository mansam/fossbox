Summary: Today we celebrated this sunny Thursday by packing up the FOSSBox since we are moving into Golisano tomorrow. I haven't spent much time in there but I do like the location - its open which I feel is going to be much better than some lab. We shall see tomorrow I suppose.  Along the boxing theme we had round one of Red Hat conference calls with some designers and memebers of their branding/marketing team. It went really well.

Today we celebrated this sunny Thursday by packing up the FOSSBox since we are
moving into Golisano tomorrow. I haven't spent much time in there but I do
like the location - its open which I feel is going to be much better than some
lab. We shall see tomorrow I suppose.

Along the boxing theme we had round one of Red Hat conference calls with some
designers and memebers of their branding/marketing team. It went really well.
I didn't talk much but listening in gave me a better idea of what we are
doing. In this next week or so we are going to come up with some Gource
"templates" to give everyone an idea of what these videos could look like. I
am looking forward to getting started with that. Hopefully tomorrow I will get
a chance to play with some settings. I would love to whip up a mock-up really
quickly.

I am looking forward to getting some productive things done very soon.
