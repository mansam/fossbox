It feels like it just started, but the HFOSS Spring course is already past
half-done! Perhaps the 13 day excursion to Silicon Valley and Harvard had
something to do with that...

## Part 1: PyCon 2013: Santa Clara, CA

[FOSS@RIT](http://foss.rit.edu) took four students out to [PyCon
2013](http://us.pycon.org). There were two main components to our Lab's
involvment at PyCon; the Education Summit, and the [Poster
Session](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/posters/list/).

Details about the PyCon EDU Summit can be found
[here](https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/edusummit/), but here are the broad
strokes:

> The education summit takes place on Thursday, March 14, the day before the
main tracks of PyCon begin, so that summit attendees will be able to attend
all of the regular talks.

>

> The summit is scheduled to run all day, from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm, with breaks
in the morning and afternoon and one hour for lunch. The morning session will
tentatively include a keynote speaker and 3 panel discussions (audience
participation encouraged) on the three general areas of the summit -
engagement, curriculum and teaching. The afternoon session will be an
unconference workshop where attendees can gather into interest groups to
discus the issues raised in the morning.
