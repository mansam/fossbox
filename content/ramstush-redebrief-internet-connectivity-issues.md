This blog post is meant to supplement my inability to attend debrief yesterday
(Thursday June 28th) due to me being unable to connect to an internet
connection.

#Old Buisness

ACTION: brush ask for some badges to test with

nope

ACTION: brush make some circles with new inkscape skills to play with

done

ACTION: brush get Sash onto the xo

nope

ACTION: brush ping #sugar about saving whole files into DSObject

pinged, no response, found how to link the files correctly on my own.

ACTION: brush access data from the DSObject

nope, not enough documentation on the web for sugar datastores....will have to
continue to research T__T

ACTION: brush find a way to listen in on the meeting

nope, couldn't get internet

#New Buisness

#action brush keep plugging away at trying to figure out datastore intricacies
whatever way you can...

#action brush get some dummy code into Sash just to get it onto the XO

#action brush *remind yourself not to get pressured into visiting support
network when internet is unknown, and is still a work day....*

#G/B/U

Good: Panera Bread has wonderful wifi and really tasty tea. Bad: No continuous
internet all day. Couldn't attend debrief. #sugar didn't reply all day. iPhone
IRC was/is unreliable. Ugly: Jeep wouldn't turn over this morning. Haven't
recieved a paycheck yet from Co-Op. (going on for 5 weeks?)

#Final Thoughts

Things never go the way you want the too. Planning only does so much, then
karma kicks in :/ (literally kicks things in).
