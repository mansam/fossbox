So here i am blogging away after almost a week without blogging at all. man I
need to do this more often. Anyway so these past couple days we've been
attending all of these special events here at RIT., The first was on Saturday
and that was FOSSCON. We had a booth there and we basically just spent the day
hanging out and manning the booth. We talked to some people from other
universities and such and it was overall pretty cool. Then on Monday, NTID
held a symposium on teaching to deaf and hard of hearing students and that
continued until about 12:00 today. It was kind of boring because the last
couple days have just been us manning the booth and not really getting much
code or other stuff done. So that finally ended today and now I am back to
work.

I've been working on making a test that will run all the different types of
sprite sheet setups. I have yet to test my code but everything I've done so
far should work relatively well. hope ton have that done by the end of this
week. Our original schedule was to have it done by the end of this week but
there is just too much going on this week. On top of the Symposium we are also
visiting the Strong Museum of Play and Second Avenue Games tomorrow. Then on
top of that Friday is our usual lazy day. So with all that in mind we pushed
our goals back a week and figured it would not be too big of a deal. I guess
that is all for today. I will post more soon, and I will post a lot about what
we do tomorrow at the museum and the games company.
