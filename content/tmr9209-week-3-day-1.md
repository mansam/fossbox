Today we completed a matrix which focused on mechanics of social, RPG, and MMO
games. We looked at particular mechanics such as classes, quests, crafting,
and leveling up. Then we went into various components for each mechanic with

how it can break the game. In addition to this matrix the group also went

Finally, we had a meeting for how the rest of the week will progress. Our work
tomorrow will be based off of an email from SJ which will be sent out tonight.
