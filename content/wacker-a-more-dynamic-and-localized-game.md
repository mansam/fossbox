The team, Stephen Jacobs, and myself began talking about creating a more
dynamic feel to the game. What I mean by this is making the game feel like

For example, maybe somebody would want a hamburger stand or even an ice cream
stand. To show this dynamic and customized version of the game, we will be
able to load in different sets of images and ingredients to the game with a
simple click of the button or simply adding in what kind of stand you would
want to the command line.

I have created [a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-
stand/issues/24) that I will be working on along side with our artist Jenn who
is currently putting together some images for these new sets of stands. I
began by running through [Lemonade
Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) and looking at text that I
should make dynamic depending on what version of the stand people would like
to run.
