Things have been quite a blur since starting graduate studies in the fall.

Cycles are scarce.

Pressure is high.

The plate has been piled higher than ever.

My "happy place" has been elusive.

Sometimes, you just gotta write effing code. Being able to pip install any
library under the sun and cobble together an app or script that just does what
you want it to do is one of the best feelings in the world. Like an artist
painting with every color of the python rainbow, or a carpenter with every
tool in the shed (except the double claw-hammer), it feels so good to
conceptualize something, even something silly, and then just build it.

Off to learning more about mako, so I can (ab)use python to write html, and
build me some fluid grid layouts.
