So what I was working on was trying to merge my feature branch into the
develop branch on github so I could close my last ticket. After that I was
planning on working on the presentation that team Lemonade Stand will be
giving at flock in our Mozilla Badges in Sugar. However merging turned out to
be a nightmare. It was awe full. Then in the middle of the merge other members
of team Lemonade Stand made a large number of large commits to develop. So now
I have to do a second merge after repairing some of my code that got damaged
from the code going in two different directions. Tomorrow will be interesting.
