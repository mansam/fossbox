I finished all of the finishing touches to the first version of the new UI
including a menu screen, difficulty screen, a tutorial of a short slide of
images, and the challenge mode which caps the playing time after summer is
over. For now, we defined summer as 90 days and after that the user will be
taken back to the main menu to play again if they please.

I spent more of the morning typing up descriptions for each tutorial screen
hoping that I was descriptive enough so that after children go through the
tutorial, I would not have to explain any other directions. This is going to
need some playtesting to see if my theory or hope is correct.

The team and I are also beginning to talk about creating an activity on XO
laptop to display all of the user's current badges.
