Summary: The [RocPy](http://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Python-Meetup/) meetup for October mostly consisted of lightning talks from students in the HFOSS course with our project ideas. It was a little boring in terms of presentation, mostly because they are only ideas at this point; nothing has been implemented.  My group gave our talk on the WeatherStation activity we hope to make. Our presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mwnIw M74QtqYa4DF40oX9ZszIJwdEbochZqCFhcYX5M/edit ... 

The [RocPy](http://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Python-Meetup/) meetup for October
mostly consisted of lightning talks from students in the HFOSS course with our
project ideas. It was a little boring in terms of presentation, mostly because
they are only ideas at this point; nothing has been implemented.

My group gave our talk on the WeatherStation activity we hope to make. Our
presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mwnIw
M74QtqYa4DF40oX9ZszIJwdEbochZqCFhcYX5M/edit?usp=sharing). There seemed to be a
real interest in the sensors there, which is no surprise to me because
hardware is **AWESOME!** Most people interested in computers deal almost
exclusively with software. I think it is really neat how receptive everyone
has been to our hardware based project that is a bit different than the normal
projects.
