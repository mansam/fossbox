# Productively Lost part Deux

Today I messed around with the
[XSCE](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition) a bit more. I
had been taking notes on different functions for a while now, but after
understanding the main functions I realized the answers I were looking for
weren't in there. I was only seeing how it was supposed to work, and being sad
when it didn't. Unfortunately I had bit off more than I could chew with this
task. Perhaps the reason I agreed to solve the school server problem was
because I wanted to solve a difficult problem by myself. Being the only
[Computer Scientist](http://www.cs.rit.edu/) on the team, I wanted to prove
myself as being multifaceted; the other students are [Game
Designers](http://games.rit.edu/) or [New Media
Development](http://games.rit.edu/node/142) majors. I wanted to solve the
issues with the network and save the day so we all stop worrying about how the
gap between the game [Lemonade
Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) and the system of
[Mozilla's Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/about/) will mesh together in a
brilliant dance of hacking harmony.

If I wanted to have a server that worked I shouldn't have just looked at how
it's parts worked together, I should've corrected the way the network worked
to adapt to our systems.
