## Lightning Talks @ InterlockROC Hacker/Maker Space

Here's the idea: Presenters (that's you!) have 5 minutes to talk about
anything they think would be interesting to share. After 5 minutes, you're
done, and another presentation jumps up to start. This turns into a fun fast
paced way of sharing ideas that you're interested in.

The crowd is generally tech savvy but no subject is out of scope.

Partipication is open to everyone. The more the better. If you have something
you think is fun, make a presentation. For any questions, contact info [at]
interlockroc.org

EDIT: Food and Drinks will be served at 7pm. Presentations will begin at 8pm.
