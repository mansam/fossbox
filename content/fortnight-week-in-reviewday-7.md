Summary: One Week Down! ... 

One Week Down!

I know what I have to do for this project, and I know why I have to do it, all
that remains now is the how.

Here's a day by day break down of what happened:

##  Day 0:

Bootstrapping

-> Installed Fedora on my comp  
-> TIL laptops can be called "Boxes"  
-> Created accounts on many websites:  
-->> [ We use github to share our code ](https://github.com/fortnight)  
-->> [ We used this to register for Flock ](http://fedoraproject.org/)  
-->> [ We use this to chat in our debrief meetings ](http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml)  
-->> [ Where we blog, don't bother clicking it, you're already there ](foss.rit.edu)  
-->> all accounts are under the name "fortnight", origin story later

##  Day 1:

Sugar and Lemonade

-> Yum installed many nifty linux programs  
-> TIL about desktop environments  
-> Installed [Sugar](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki) on my "Box"  
-> Tried out almost all the programs... A couple didn't work :-(  
-> Playtested [Lemonade stand ](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand)  
-> Decided as a group what changes/improvements could be made to the game

##  Day 2:

Boxing Day

-> Packed up FOSSbox into other boxes  
-> Feasted on glorious wings  
-> TIL the sweetness of Mango in "Mango Habanero" wings does not detract from the spiciness of the Habanero  
-> Coded on the FOSScouch - [It kinda looked like this](http://www.dwell.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/bolla-sofa-cb21.jpg?itok=HB6ngjs5)  
-> Studied the [Lemonade stand wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) and compared it to our findings  
-> Original project leader of Lemonade Stand works with us at FOSS

##  Day 3:

Moving day

-> Moved the FOSSbox up to FOSSnorth  
-> Ate some sweet [free pizza](http://writtenoncompanytime.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/free-pizza.jpg)  
-> TIL about ["Miyamoto's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto) [ Pyramid"](http://www.thelivingmoon.com/43ancients/04images/Pyramid/Mayan_El_Castilo.JPG) (I hope that's the right Miyamoto, and I hope you like the pyramid, they are different links)  
-->> Basically as time passes working on a project, the pyramid gets bigger  
-->> The core of the pyramid, what constituted the center column, is most important for game developers  
-->> as more things get added around it, they decrease in importance  
-> Placed improvements to the game in different layers of the pyramid

##  Day 4:

National day of civic Hackathon

-> Met someone who works for Wikipedia!  
-> [More Free pizza](http://www.grubgrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/freepizza.jpg)  
-> API's arent that complicated  
-> TIL the data base of the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/info/developers/download/) is super complicated  
-> Ruby is complicated to compile on linux

##  Day 5:

National Day of civic Hackathon part deux

-> After sleeping I had more confidence  
-> TIL coding for large data sets is super hard and takes a while to see if you coded things right  
-> I wrote simple code to figure out what the different categories of the Database said  
-> I didn't know how to upload it to [My Github Repository](https://github.com/fortnight/reaDPLA)  
-> I half-heartedly presented my struggles on my box  
-> I made a goofy face when the WXXI reporter when took a picture of the room
