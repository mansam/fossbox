Hi! My name is Suzanne Reed. I am a Computer Engineering student and have just
finished my second year at RIT. This summer I am lucky enough to have an co-op
with Red Hat at the RIT FossBOX working with Gource. With Gource, we hope to
create a UI to simplify Gource for the average user and develop Gource videos
to illustrate the overall impact of Red Hat in many projects.

I am really excited to get started and gain experience working on my first
open source software project. My personal goal is to gain experience
developing a project and begin to create a real presence for myself online.
Most importantly, we are hoping to create a tool that will be used by the Red
Hat community and continue to be used and grow after this summer.
