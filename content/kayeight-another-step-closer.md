The person dashboard is finally starting to come together, and hopefully will
be up on the CIVX website very soon. Yesterday I started modifying it to be
able to take the name of a senator from a jQuery selector, before generating
its tabs. I ran into a bit of a roadblock then, trying to figure out how to
pass information around between the different components of the widget. I'm
currently trying to solve an error when embedding python in a Genshi template
- should get that ironed out today with help from the community.
