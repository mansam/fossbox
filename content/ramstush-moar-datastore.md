Summary: Well this is troubling. Since I've taken on the task of understanding how the journal works in the OLPC XO laptops, I have learned a great deal of information regarding the sugar datastore. HOWEVER, as I claim more and more knowledge for myself, I keep finding myself at points where I cannot physically progress my understand because the only documented information about datastore is contained within [this single document](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore).

Well this is troubling. Since I've taken on the task of understanding how the
journal works in the OLPC XO laptops, I have learned a great deal of
information regarding the sugar datastore. HOWEVER, as I claim more and more
knowledge for myself, I keep finding myself at points where I cannot
physically progress my understand because the only documented information
about datastore is contained within [this single
document](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore). Its a 1 to 1
ratio, the more knowledge I obtain, the more questions I have that I can't
answer. My only reprieve is that #sugar can usually guide my questioning so I
can eventually find out what I needed to learn in the first place. As is
stands I know how to save files to a DSObject, but I've been getting an error
that reads "** Message: pygobject_register_sinkfunc is deprecated
(HippoCanvasBox)" I've seen the HippoCanvasBox before in python, but idk how
to find the replacement if the pyobject_register_sinkfunc is indeed
deprecated.

The journey continues, and I recruited some help from a fellow team member
David W. his handle in IRC is "DAWacker". We'll see what we can turn up. Stay
tuned.
