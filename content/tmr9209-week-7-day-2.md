Summary: Today we began the process of prototyping our game. After flushing out a few things, we began playing out our attack simulation representing the actual combat within the game. By doing this we found several potential issues and problems with our system, which we modified and fixed. The major two changes was that the three types of blocks became a standard block which would stun the opponent and allow extra damage on the next "turn" within the simulation.

Today we began the process of prototyping our game. After flushing out a few

combat within the game. By doing this we found several potential issues and

was that the three types of blocks became a standard block which would stun
the opponent and allow extra damage on the next "turn" within the simulation.
Beyond this, we also brainstormed prototypes for other various parts of our
game and solved other issues.
