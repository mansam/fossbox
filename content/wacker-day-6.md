Today was an exciting learning day, not saying that every day is not! Today we
had a great Git/Vim tutorial presented to us by our own Nate! This was an
awesome introduction/clarification session. I knew the very very basics to
sucessfully hack remotely for the [hackathon](http://hackforchange.org/) that
was last weekend, but during this session I learned how to deal with merge
errors! yay! With this, I installed [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) which is a
great interactive tool that helps resolve ugly merge conflicts. I also
acquired a very nice [cheat sheet](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-
sheet-medium.png) for GitHub commands within the terminal!

On a side note, I was able to complete the new Lemonade Stand structure
diagram!
