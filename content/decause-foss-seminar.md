I am more than excited to be taking the FOSS projects Seminar course here at
RIT. This class is shaping up to be all the things they didn't teach you in
school that you need to know when you enter into the world of FOSS.

## Syllabus

[The RIT Seminar in FOSS
Course](http://readthedocs.org/docs/ritfloss/en/latest/)

It is quite a switch in context for me, but really not. I have always
considered my students as colleagues, and now we're playing on the same field
and being evaluated under the same criteria. This is how it works in
Opensource too; Foo walks. Whether you are a 13 year old script kiddie, or an
OGB (Original GreyBeard) the only thing that matters is the code. It is almost
easier for me to face a community of random folks than it is to risk failing
in front of my students from the FOSSBox. But I'm excited to fail early, and
hopefully not so often ;)

I am pretty effing stoked for the group project, and plan on submitting for
the [STEM Video Game Challenge](http://www.stemchallenge.org) either way.I've
been trying to brainstorm for this group project for the last few months, and
have a few ideas kicking around, but nothing definite.

Elements I would like to include:

  * Open Data
  * Physics in the game mechanics
  * RPG style levelling up
  * Tower defense style waves of enemies
  * Turn based game play to avoid bandwidth limitations
  * An 8-bit or ASCII graphical aesthetic

This is a good start, and I will be posting here weekly at the very least.
