I spent a good amount of time looking through the
[LemonadeGui.py](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-
stand/blob/develop/LemonadeGui.py) both the version before our changes and
after the changes we made during the summer, trying to figure out how it is
all put together so I could put in a small option to select which recipe you
would want to make for the next day. I've tried many different ways of the the
last few days but nothing worked. Now I fully understand what all the methods
are doing. By the end of tomorrow I shall be finished with the way to select
recipes.
