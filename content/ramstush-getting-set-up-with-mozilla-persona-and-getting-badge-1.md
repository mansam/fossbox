Summary: Today we had a lot of busy work in Lemonade world. We finished creating our github tickets, and just need to assign these tickets to our team members. With this done, I turned my focus to researching Mozilla Open Badges.

Today we had a lot of busy work in Lemonade world. We finished creating our
github tickets, and just need to assign these tickets to our team members.
With this done, I turned my focus to researching Mozilla Open Badges.

My first search into Mozilla brought me to the [OpenBadges.org
Site](http://www.openbadges.org/) which is the poster site for Open Badges. It
gives new users a new summary and explains what Open Badges is. I learned,
that to be able to receive badges, you need to have a backpack, and that a
backpack is allotted for you when you create a [Mozilla Persona
Account](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/). At the bottom of this page
you simply fill out your email and hit the sign me up button to get a Mozilla
persona account.

Getting your first Badge:

Once you have a persona account, you can go
[Here](http://www.openbadges.org/earn/) to earn your first badge to properly
set up your backpack. At the end of the bullet points, there is a line that
look like this:

"Need a demo? Take the badges 101 quiz and earn a badge in the process!"

Click this link to learn a little more about open badges and snag an easy
badge as you go. After completing the quiz, just follow the on screen
instructions and you'll be able to post your badge to your backpack.
