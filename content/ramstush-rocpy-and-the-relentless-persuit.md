Summary: Tuesday was an immensely more productive day than the preceding Monday. Without power outages, we were able to get down to work quickly, and stay focused.  After catching up with my blogs, I began a new search into the Journal of OLPC by pining the #sugar irc room. A fantastic fellow with the irc handle of "dnarvaes" pointed me towards the sugar GIThub repository of the journal which you can find Here.

Tuesday was an immensely more productive day than the preceding Monday.
Without power outages, we were able to get down to work quickly, and stay
focused.

After catching up with my blogs, I began a new search into the Journal of OLPC
by pining the #sugar irc room. A fantastic fellow with the irc handle of
"dnarvaes" pointed me towards the sugar GIThub repository of the journal which
you can find Here. The relevant modules of the sugar repositories are sugar,
sugar-toolkit-gtk3, and sugar-datastore. Before I inspected the actual journal
code, another IRC user by the handle of "gonzalo_odiard" pointed me towards a
wiki page about [how datastore works in sugar](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/De
velopment_Team/Almanac/sugar.datastore.datastore). I went over the docs to get
a feel for it, but I still need to review the docs in depth to fully grasp the
concept of the datastore.

The main event of yesterday was attending the Rochester Python User Group
Meeting or ROCpy. The entire FOSSbox traveled there and attended a lecture on
threading in python, and also get lightning talks on what we all were working
on this summer with FOSS@RIT. We had lightning talks about Skytime, Lemonade
Stand, Gource, Fedbadges, EPAUV, and even more awesome code bits that made a
huge impression. We're all excited to have support out in the community, if
you want to join the ROCpy user group, or if you just want to check out the
group itself, you can find it's website [here](http://www.rocpy.org/). See you
all tomorrow!
