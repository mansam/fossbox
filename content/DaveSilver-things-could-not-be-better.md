Summary: So I am finally finished with my Sprite Sheet testing environment and it works great. Basically what I have done, is make a test program that runs the same basic test we have been doing in all the other situations on multiple different types of sprite sheets. By doing this test we have the ability to see what style of sprite sheet will give us the best frame rate in our animation system.

So I am finally finished with my Sprite Sheet testing environment and it works
great. Basically what I have done, is make a test program that runs the same
basic test we have been doing in all the other situations on multiple
different types of sprite sheets. By doing this test we have the ability to
see what style of sprite sheet will give us the best frame rate in our
animation system. So ideally next week when we are planning our animation
system we will not only know the best image formats to use but we will also
know the best ways to use those image formats. On top of that the tests will
help us to try and determine why each format and setup works as well or as
badly as it does.

As far as test results go, I have not yet run the tests themselves but I will
be doing so in about an hour. Before I run the tests I still have a few simple
edits to make to the files and I have to restart my XO so that I am running
the tests from a "clean" environment. Ideally I will be able to post the
results today but if not expect them for tomorrow.

Have a good one.
