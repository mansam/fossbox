Our valiant leader was unable to be with us in person but he was with us in
spirit and irc. But the one and only threebean stepped up to the plate and
taught the humble Lemonade Stand team how to use
[gitflow](http://vimeo.com/16018419) so that we may be more efficient at
collaberating on large projects.

What I had worked on was learning how to build a sugar activity on to an XO
because I had never done that myself personally. I needed to do this because
the resolution of Lemonade Stand was made larger and I can only see about one
fourth of the game on my box. So to play test I needed to put the activity on
to an XO. After I was play testing for a while I noticed some really broken
balancing with the games and that the change I made to make events not show up
until day five worked to well and that no events were showing up at all. So
these are things I need to fix.
