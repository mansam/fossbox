Hey world it's been a while!!

I took a bit of time to get used to the new semester system that RIT is using
instead of our dearly loved quarterly system. In the mean time I've had some
thing happening and continue to happen that I believe I should blog about to
get some stability back into my work life.

Past things that have been going on:

Summer COOP was glorious! I can't believe the amount of awesome individuals
that I've met and am continuing to meet through the Fossbox and it's many
faithful members.

Currently, I'm loving Objective - C as I am learning to develop iPhone Apps in
a mobile games development course I'm taking. As a result, I finally obtained
a new computer, a macbox that I've devoted to being a dev/work box.

I helped the Fossbox in setting up the Software Freedom Day hackathon by
creating a facebook event as well as throwing the flyer around RIT's social
networks to spread the word. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend due to
previous commitments, but I visited near the end to see that Remy D. was
rockin and rollin SWFD as always!

New things that are going to be going on:

This weekend we have the Hack Upstate hackathon happening in Syracuse NY. The
dates are the 12-13th of Oct. I'm not sure of the location but throw decause a
ping in channel and he'll set you up with the details.

I'm currently bootstrapping my macbox because Unix is pretty similar to Linux
and hooray!!

A fellow Fossboxer, nicked: Mansam, introduced me to HomeBrew. Its a package
manager for Mac that's like Fedora's YUM. So far vim and python have been
installed and updated and I'm still working on getting my github setup and
Fossbox server access to remember my irc backchannel

Thats the up and coming for this week, other than working on a ton of school
work, I'm having a blast!
