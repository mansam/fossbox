# Boxing day

Today we packed up the FOSSbox into smaller boxes, before feasting on wings
and commemorating the FOSScouch! Imagine the most comfy couch, now add
sunlight and an equally comfy footrest. It was wonderful. My only complaint
was that I couldn't nap and code at the same time. Speaking of coding, I also
did some project work today. We looked over the Lemonade stand wiki and
compared our wishlist to theirs: [Lemonade Stand
Wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand). I also looked over the
base code again to see what enhancements were more feasible.

In other news, I looked a basic tutorial on **HTML!!!** because I knew very
little about it. I also wanted to jazz up these blog posts and not `seem like
an emotionless robot`

hehehe...
