I am Ian Furry, a student entering my senior year at Rochester Institute of
Technology studying Game Design and Development. Over the summer, as part of
the Summer Undergraduate Research Foundation, I'll be implementing Mozilla
Open Badges in the game Lemonade Stand for the XO of One Laptop per Child. I

software class and creating a educational activity from scratch for Sugar.
From this experience I hope to get a better understanding of Linux and Python.

My current github account is ianf2768
