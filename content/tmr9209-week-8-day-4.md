Today we finished working on the materials and came up with how many materials
would be awarded for committing code. We also helped David in his character
sheet by coming up with stats and skills that would go on the sheet and what
FOSS data would determine them on the character sheet. To accomplish this, we
had to find information on the top programming languages and understand the
FOSS data that could be used.

Finally, we started the process of preparing for the play testing. We created
several scripts to explain to the play testers what our game is about, how it
operates, and how they will play it. This will be beneficial next week when
the play testing starts taking place.
