Day 7.5

# Code Diving

->Learned good ways to search through large packages of code  
-->> "grep -inr SEARCH_TERM * | less"  
-->> recursively search through the current directory and it's files for the SEARCH_TERM  
->Got some cool advice from [Threebean](http://threebean.org/blog/)  
-> I miscounted the days so far, but am back on track now
