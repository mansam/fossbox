Today I mocked up some standards for each group of badges. (FOSS@RIT, Fedora,
and OLPC) None of this is set in stone! I am currently having several internal
debates about how some of this stuff will work. I would love to talk this out
with you guys tomorrow and make some decisions on what the design standards of
the badges will be.

I heard back from a couple of people on the Fedora design team. Very positive
feedback :D but also some suggestions for functionality.
