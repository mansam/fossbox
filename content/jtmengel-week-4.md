This week has been a little bit crazy; between my hours trying to get an
example of DirtySprite and Sprite objects running with print outs to the
terminal, I've been helping out a friend with programming a plugin to parse
.pdb (Protein Database) files and process the information through some
calculations specified by some unfortunately complicated-looking statistical
equations. In what spare time I have, I've been drawing from an excellent
workshop book on anatomy and stance.

The biggest obstacles have been A) General Programmer's Block with the Fortune
Hunter material, which have led me to researching a LOT of libraries, re
familiarizing myself with data structures and where to use them (special
thanks to Geoff A. for letting me bounce ideas off him), and reading others'
code to absorb different manners of syntax in Python (which of course, I am
learning to code in Pep-8 compliance).

Basically, no new *deep* illuminations on how to code like in weeks 1 and 2
where I was learning python, but this week has shown me a lot of different
ways to do the same thing; this information will definitely help when it comes
down to optimizing the code to run faster. Couple that with the introduction
my work with the Protein Databases forcing me to learn ctype (the importing of
C datatypes) and I'm starting to feel a little dangerous with Python.

"An hour spent with a teacher is equal to a day in the library, which is equal
to a year in the lab," or ...

"Seconds spent typing the question in IRC is equal to an hour reading
documentation, which is equal to months spent programming blindly."
