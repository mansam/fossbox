So this week my plan is to finish up the test program for sprite sheets and to
begin running the actual tests. I have not actually run any tests yet but by
the end of the day I should have run a preliminary test just to make sure
everything I have done so far works. Once I am confident I am on the right
track things will get much easier. JT is in a similar situation with his test
program and our goal is to be able to start developing our final animation
system b y the middle of next week at the latest. Wish us luck, and I will
post more later.
