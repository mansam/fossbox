Summary: Hi There! ... 

Hi There!

My name is Remy, and my handle is decause in most places. This is my first
time taking HFOSS for credit, but not my first time being involved in the
course. This is my last *official* course that I need to take to complete my
graduate studies here at RIT, and I couldn't think of a class I'd want to end
on more than this one :)

There are any number of Sugar Activities that I could choose as my favorite,
but I'm going to go with some some that I've had the privilege of helping out
through [FOSS@RIT](http://foss.rit.edu):

## OpenVideoChat

Most video chat programs available today are biased toward audio. Meaning that
when bandwidth is constrained, video gets dropped for priority of the audio
stream. This is problematic for Deaf/Hard of Hearing users, as ASL requires
minimum framerates of 13-15/fps to be understandable.

Enter OVC. The goal of the project was to develop a prototype that could
provide chat at least the minimum framerate on the XO's limited hardware. The
project was released for the XO 1.5 units, and on the local builds the
students made, they had achieved their goal. Since the peak development of
2010-2011, there have been many library improvements upstream, and we are
hoping some brave students will help port OVC to the latest bits this
spring/summer.

## Mathematical Adventure: Fortune Hunter

Fortune Hunter is a Dungeon Adventure Game, based on the 4th Grade Math
Curriculum in NY and MA. It challenges players to solve interesting math
problems, that are not simply typing in the answer to an equation.

Not only was the game developed, but a game engine, an animation engine, and a
level editor for teachers to make new dungeons. Here is an (somewhat lengthy)
demo video of gameplay:

## Lemonade Stand

Lemonade Stand is just like it sounds; a game where players run a virtual
lemonade stand. Players have to make change, do inventory, and calculate
recipe proportions. Each day there are also environment changes and events
that impact gameplay, like weather patterns, traffic accidents, and ants!
