# Assignment and Ouya

Today we wrapped up assigning issues for phase one to one another, as well as
decide our team roles. For the first trimester, I got assigned the issue about
connecting to [school
servers](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3) and
looking into creating an [Mozilla Open Badge](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges)
allotment system.

Near the end of the day, I got to playtest the [Ouya Android Gaming
System](http://www.ouya.tv/).

I got some valuable gametesting experience from playing the following games:

[A Bit of a Fist of Awesome](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/49-a-bit-of-a
-fist-of-awesome) - A side scrolling 8-bit street fighting game, where you a
lumberjack possessed by the fist of awesome to save the world from an army
time-traveling woodland creatures. Great Story!

[Garnatron](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/124-garnatron) - A Shoot 'em up
game with a variety of superpowers, and in which if multiple controllers are
plugged in, they all can control the same spaceship

[Flashout 3d](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/119-flashout-3d) - A Racing
game featuring boosts, hovercars with guns and missles, all in a futuristic
locale.

[Final Fantasy III](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/3-final-fantasy-iii) -
The Third game in the final fantasy series. A solid RPG, I didn't play long
enough to grasp the story.

[Polarity](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/112-polarity) - A platformer
puzzle game reminiscent of portal, due to the lab it takes place in. One has
to switch their polarity as they run through a first-person maze of lasers,
jump ramps, and charged platforms.

[God of Blades](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/19-god-of-blades) - A side
scrolling hack'n'slash, where the player is always moving forward and needs
only to time their moves in sequence to defeat the opponents that constantly
rush you. Also featured a sweet story.

[Monocle Man](http://ouyaforum.com/showthread.php?2115-Monocle-Man) - A
puzzling 3d platformer where the player plays as a cube in a finely tailored
suit complete with a top hat and monacle. Each level takes place in an
hourglass, and sand is filling up from the middle outward, always threatening
to make you restart the level if you touch it.
