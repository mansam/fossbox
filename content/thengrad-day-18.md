Today was a good day. I tried joining in on the order of wings with everyone
and determined that I do not like it and won't be joining any future orders. I
also redesigned how the game Lemonade Stand selects the random events in an
attempt to make it be able to change the frequencies of events based on
difficulty. However this has no made the Impossible difficulty a little to
hard so I need to re-balance the events. With my new design we also need a few
more events to really spice up the game. So I'm going to be busy tomorrow.
