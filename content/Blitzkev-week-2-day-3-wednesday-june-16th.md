Yesterday I developed the new battleengine further, and fixed a bug on trac
pertaining to clearing text. The ticket can be found here [https://fedorahoste
d.org/fortune_hunter/ticket/21](https://fedorahosted.org/fortune_hunter/ticket
/21) and the git commit is here [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=fortune_hu
nter.git;a=commit;h=f5bf0bb...](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=fortune_hun
ter.git;a=commit;h=f5bf0bbf775fe7c77e77322988d4830dad14e087) . Today I've been
looking at what needs to be done in order for MAFH to become a core sugar
activity. Later I plan on working more on porting the game engine.

Edit: Helped JT get the test aggregator up and running.
