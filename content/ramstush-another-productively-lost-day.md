Last Friday was our first real "Work From Home Friday". I woke up that morning
with confidence in finding the way the OLPC journal talks to each activity and
vice versa. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. I spent the greater part of
the day unsuccessfully pinging Google and the interwebz for some information
on this ticket of mine. Having another day where I felt like I made no
progress whatsoever isn't very encouraging....As a last ditch effort, I pinged
#sugar in IRC hoping that they would be able to point me in the right
direction, but to no avail. I left my laptop to clear my head and rethink my
strategy in finding the answer to my ticket. After about 15 min of thinking, I
figured out that I would just get a copy of the journal code and a sugar build
activity that already prints to the journal and rip them apart to find what
made them talk. The normal sugar activities are found
[Here](http://activities.sugarlabs.org//en-US/sugar/) at the sugar labs
activity downloads. After obtaining a working activity, I searched the web for
the sugar github repository and found that they are set up in Gitorious at
[git.Sugarlabs](https://git.sugarlabs.org/). After creating an account, I was
able to grab a copy of the journal and start inspecting the code. I have yet
to find the code that links, but I am still determined to get it.
