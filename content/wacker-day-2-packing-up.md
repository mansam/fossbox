Sadly today we packed up the FOSSbox :( We are preparing to move to a
different location for the remainder of the summer as the Innovation Center
will be renovated for new work space and the FOSSbox 3.0.

Most of the day was packing up computer components, posters, and a whole lot
of books. My task was organizing books with my buddy Ryan and packing and
labeling boxes accordingly.

Since it was Thursday, it was also Buffalo Wild Wings Day! For those who don't
know what this is, it is a special that Buffalo Wild Wings has on Thursdays
where boneless chicken wings are 65 cents each! This was an awesome reward
after moving and packing up everything.

I was also successful at completing my config file for irssi and being able to
auto connect to irc.freenode.net as well as auto joining the #rit-foss
channel! My group and I also figured out a wish list for Lemonade Stand and
prioritized the list according to what is essential, what would be nice, and a
wish list of features we would like to add if time permits in this cycle of
development. There is a diagram of how the game worked before and a wish list
of the last cycle here [Lemonade Stand
Wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand).

I will be working on a new diagram later and show how we will be incorporating
Open Badges into Lemonade Stand as well as any new features we agree on
implementing. Overall very successful day!
