Summary: Datastore:  Not much to report this week, as I can only make so many posts about the sugar datastore and it's lack of documentation or information for that matter. After a week of pinging the IRC room #sugar, I have only found one page of reference to learn how to use this particular datastore (you can find this page [ here ](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore)).

Datastore:

Not much to report this week, as I can only make so many posts about the sugar
datastore and it's lack of documentation or information for that matter. After
a week of pinging the IRC room #sugar, I have only found one page of reference
to learn how to use this particular datastore (you can find this page [ here
](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore)). Needless to say, this
is rather frustrating and I can only figure it out as I try to work with it in
the actual activity.

Sash Activity:

Sash activity is up and running as far as activities are concerned. Making an
activity is exceptionally easy due to the better guide I found on the web (I
have countless blog posts with the link). Jenn, our "in house" graphic artist
provided the svg and artwork for the activity, and the code to actually make
it do something is in the works. Seeing as the code is the only think keeping
it from the XO the activity is practically done.

Lemonade Stand:

The enhancement team is blazing forth in remaking the game with some new
features as well as updating the graphics. Its all pretty exciting to see a
new fresh look on Lemonade Stand and some new features as well including
difficulty and some more options. Once it's "localized" it'll be up on the web
so, keep an eye out for it.

Monday this week:

A programming legend is visiting us in the box tomorrow, so we know things are
going to get done. We have the 4th of July off, so its going to be a short
work week. Time to buckle down and get it done. See ya later!
