Summary: I was at my friend’s birthday party this past weekend. I was watching the fire pit to the sounds of bouncing Ping-Pong balls and sloshing beverages when, wouldn't yah know it, I got sucked into a conversation about Free and Open Source Software.

I was at my friend’s birthday party this past weekend. I was watching the fire
pit to the sounds of bouncing Ping-Pong balls and sloshing beverages when,
wouldn't yah know it, I got sucked into a conversation about Free and Open
Source Software.

At this point I am decently comfortable with FOSS things. I know how stuff
gets done, I understand the mentality and culture behind it, I have been
working at FOSS@RIT a while now. I don’t necessarily participate in it all,
but I like its academia, its debates, the myths it debunks.

So I must have been a real eloquent speaker right?

Of course not. Understanding something and verbalizing something is apparently
not the same thing, at all! Talking about this stuff can be pretty difficult,
many props to Remy, his job is tough!

The conversation soon turned to media playing programs. The big question of
the night: what is a good open source music player? A quick Google search
returned: Songbird, Miro, Clementine...Are any of these actually any good?
Does anybody have one that they use?

I’ve been using Window’s Media Player and it always crashes, I have I-Tunes,
but I only use it to sync my IPod. I am ready to make a change!

…

On a more work related note, I am mostly working on assets for lemonade stand.
I made some ice cubes today. :p I’ll get back to hacking on badges tomorrow
when I am back in Rochester.

Peace
