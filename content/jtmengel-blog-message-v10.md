My name's Scott JT Mengel, I'm a student at RIT enrolled in their Medical
Informatics program and this project is my first studio setting game
programming experience. Previously I've worked at the University of Rochester
as a game programmer, making software for the treatment of amblyopia. Beyond
that, I've gone to school at the Rocky Mountain School of Art and Design and
RIT (for a time) for animation; my purpose in this project is to take my
background with animation and programming and make things look pretty.

I'll be working with [Dave](http://foss.rit.edu/blog/14) on this project, and
we're tasked with determining the best practices for our platform, the OLPC
XO-1.0 and 1.5. We will accomplish this with copious amounts of caffeine and,
for Dave's part, [fun dip](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__cuS3eI-qzQ/SJ-

I'm a Scorpio from the year of the Dragon, and I like turtles (tortoises, to
be perfectly accurate. Russian Tortoises).
