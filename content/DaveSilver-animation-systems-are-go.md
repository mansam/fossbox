Summary: So last week was pretty eventful. We visited OLPC headquarters for the Hackfest and did some very cool stuff while we were there. JT and I really got to work on figuring out how the animation system would work and are now at a great point. Basically we are starting building the first iteration of the animation system this week and should have it feature complete by the end of this week or beginning of next week. We will probably still have little bugs to work out within the system at that point  ... 

So last week was pretty eventful. We visited OLPC headquarters for the
Hackfest and did some very cool stuff while we were there. JT and I really got
to work on figuring out how the animation system would work and are now at a
great point. Basically we are starting building the first iteration of the
animation system this week and should have it feature complete by the end of
this week or beginning of next week. We will probably still have little bugs
to work out within the system at that point and will definitely still have
optimization and commenting to take care of but we will be in a great place no
matter what. I think this will be a pretty productive week because we do not
have any other commitments this week except working on our projects. Well I
will talk to you guys next time and have a good day.
