Today we just started digging into what direction we want to go in for the
game and what we want to accomplish this summer. This week we set up a good
start for our research. I personally got my blog up, got connected to the irc,
and joined github. In addition to this I did substantial research on balancing
for our game and aided others on their research. We plan to continue working
on this research for the rest of the week and have a solid rough draft of the
game design document by that time.
