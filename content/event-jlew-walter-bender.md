Dogi (Stefan Unterhauser), Adam Holt, and I were in Rochester this

week for a series of events at RIT: the OLPC Users Group Meeting; the

Dean's Lecture Series (I talked about why learning is so important;

[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6561388 video]); and the Imagine RIT

Innovation Festival. Our host was Stephen Jacobs. We spent some

quality time with his students, whom are in project teams, developing

two Sugar Activities: OVC (a video chat system being developed in

collaboration with the National Institute for the Deaf), and Fortune

Hunter, an adventure game geared towards 4th Grade mathematics. The

great thing about the program at RIT is the way in which the student

projects are being integrated into the global Sugar initative. I've

asked Steve to share his "secret sauce" with other universities so

that the model can spread.

One concrete outcome of the visit is the establishment of a Sugar

"Story Team". Remy D of the RIT Storytelling Team has volunteered to

lead the effort. Another tangible outcome is that three of the servers

donated to Sugar Labs from the Wikipedia Foundation have a new home at

RIT. Dogi worked with Steve's students to bring them up to speed on

how to maintain the servers.
