Hi everyone,

I have been bouncing around a lot with what I was working on today. I got a
decent amount done. Here is a run-down:

Lemonade Stand:

-I have been working on Lemonade Stand game screens. (And fixing up and re-aligning some shapes on the cash box image) I want to revisit them some more tomorrow, so I haven’t committed them yet.

-I changed the layout for the screen. I do not know if that can be easily done code wise, or if there was a specific layout that needs blank space in certain areas. If that is the case I can change it back. I removed the tree, and moved the lemonade stand to the right and enlarged it to balance the composition.

-I remade the lemonade stand, and removed the kid. I think not having a person makes it more adaptable between different countries and among boys and girls. I will have to redesign what the character looks like…

-I created 2 UI screens; a menu screen, and a difficulty screen. 

I am using a pretty simplified style. Rounded shapes, some transparency,
bright colors, and no gradients. I tend to think simple is better on those
small XO screens.

Fliers:

I started working on the two fliers Remy requested; Software Freedom Day, and
Rochester <3 Open APIs. I am still figuring out fonts and gathering
information, so I will not post them yet. The Software Freedom Day website
said they would be putting up more design things as it gets closer, so I will
be checking back in a while.

I did not do any badge stuff today, I’ll do more of that tomorrow.

I attached a bunch of images, take a look-see :D

It’s a nice being home. I saw my brother in his prom Outfit. He keeps talking
about how attractive he is lol. :p Hacking outdoors is also a good time.
