So I don't have as much interesting things to say about the project that I'll
be working on this summer as the rest of the group I'll be working with due to
technical difficulties. However I wasn't completely unpreductive this day.
While everyone was playtesting the game Lemonade Stand I observed their
actions and eventhough I wasn't able to contribute to the collective document
of suggested changes and badges, I discussed my ideas with the group. In my
opinion, Lemonade Stand is ok but it needs a few more negative events
considering you can earn over a million dollars in a hundred and one days in
game. The game could also a bit more complexity like more recepies or
locations. However what we do add to the game will be limited to amount of
time we can spare while were working on adding in Mozilla Open Badges.
