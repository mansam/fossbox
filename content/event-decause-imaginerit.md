# [ImagineRIT](http://rit.edu/imagine)

Arguably the largest campus wide event of the year, ImagineRIT is a showcase
of creativity and innovation of our students, faculty, and staff, for the
Greater Rochester Community. We welcome our Free/Opensource friends (or anyone
else for that matter) to stop by the FOSSBox in the [Center for Student
Innovation](http://innovation.rit.edu) and see the research and development
projects that we've been cooking up for the Big Day, and every other.
