Summary: This week I have been working on ... 

This week I have been working on
[Gourciferous](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/gourciferous), which will become the
our GUI of the combination of RIT FOSS Multi-Gource and, of course,
[Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) itself. Gourciferous will be
written entirely in Python and the GUI will be built using Glade. The goal
will be to create the most simple way to run Gource and combine GIT logs.

Another feature that Gourciferous is going to bring to the table are Templates
that will act as a guide for Gource's command line arguments. Templates will
be designed for a variety of project types including: Red Hat branded, Fedora
branded, large, small, long, and short. These templates should help the
average person get an idea of how to create the best rendering possible for
their project. Attached are some mock-ups for what the Red Hat and Fedora
branded templates may look like. These are not likely the final products, but
I think they give an idea of the styling we are hoping to use.

A lot of our goals have been put on the Gourciferous Github as tickets. These
are apt to change, but for now I think that they are a good start for the
project. One of the largest stretch goals that I would love to achieve is to
contact [Andrew Caudwell](https://github.com/acaudwell) and talk to him about
our goals for Gourciferous, and see if we could possibly get some help in
modifying Gource to make our goals more achievable, and contribute to a
project that is already being used by a ton of people. I think that Gource may
be able to utilize some of our needs, so hopefully it will be beneficial to
both projects.

Flock to Fedora
[voting](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/voting/results/flock-2013) also ended
this week and my proposed talk, "Gource: Telling Stories via Source Code" did
quite well! It finished 33rd out of 125 which will hopefully mean that I will
be presenting come August. If nothing else I will be attending because our
plane tickets and hotels have been booked! This will be my first tech
conference of any sort, and I cannot wait to go.
