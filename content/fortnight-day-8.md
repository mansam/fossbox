#  Calendars, Collaboration, and Cranking

We got our group calendar together today, and very very soon we'll have to
actually space out our milestones and plan out what's going to have to be due
when. We had a sweet vim seminar, and I got to learn about the difficult art
of vimgolf. If you don't know about vim, and like to code on the command line,
you should. Best text editor I've seen. Vim has earned my trophy for the
category, dethroning the reigning champion Microsoft word.

We also finally got on the #Sugar and #school server irc channels, to share
our findings with other people working on parallel projects, and oh man did
they boost our info.

Thank you to Aklins in particular. Now we know when the new release of Sugar's
Schoolserver software is coming out, and it's only days away!

Finally, Cranking. In preparation for tomorrow's lemonade day we had to make
sure we had four XO laptops that can run Lemonade stand that we'll show to
elementary school kids. While preparing said laptops though, we had a mishap
with power chords, and to keep one laptop alive we had to take turns [cranking

that pretended to be a power chord. It was proposed to be bundled with XO
laptops, so that children can keep their laptops alive even if their homes
have no electricity, but it made using the computer feel more like a [two-

practical idea.
