Today was mostly working on implementing the balancing concepts that we
learned from the readings from the previous week. Using them, we accomplished
balancing our game and updated our prototype. The other accomplishment with
this is that we have prepared the game to be play tested, which will be
occurring sometime this week.

We also determined our leveling system, or in another sense, determined that
progression will not occur with levels. Instead, a player will gain point to
advance skills to advance a character. These points can unlock new attacks for
the three sections (high, medium, and low). They can also unlock passives to
improves attacks of certain sections.

Finally, we finished fixing the changes that SJ wanted us to add to the
Treatment document. With this accomplished, this document and the High Concept
document have been sent to SJ and Red Hat.
