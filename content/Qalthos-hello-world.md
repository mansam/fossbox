This is my first posting despite having been here for a week, because the
zaniness that was my first week did not allow for such silly things as
intorductions. Now I finally have some of the infrastructure things worked
out, and can report on my findings.

Work has been progressing on a scraper for
[shapefiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) for the Senate. I've been
fairly successful in getting a large amount of data, (up to 7.6 GB of zip
files!) so my task today was to clean up the script and make it readable to
commit it back upstream. I had started by adding more loops to the script for
special cases, but that meant repeating the core download code. Realizing
this, I made a generalized downloader function which gets called by each loop,
simplifying individual loops into a simple

    'for URL in $URL_LIST; download $URL $FILE; done'

Well, I think it's simpler...

Each time I tweak away at this file, my bash skill gets better and better, but
whether any of this is going to stick around is another question. I always
forget the simple bashisms, like for loops and conditionals, and I can never
remember quite how variables work. But as I work more with this file, I get
more comfortable with these conventions. Though I still occasionally pine for
the occasional pythonic statement (and perhaps also for the fjords).
