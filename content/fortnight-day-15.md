Summary: # More School Server Stupidity  Hai! Today I started the McNair scholars program, and now have to run off to a class every monday and wednesday from 1:00 to 3:00 this summer. It's a refreshing change of pace, but I feel like I'm missing out on glorious FOSSbox time. I'll just have to make the most of the time that I do spend there from now on. I will no longer play lemonade stand during my breaks! After all, I already have a screenshot of [$1,000,000,000,000+](http://www.elsolet.net/wp- content/ ... 

# More School Server Stupidity

Hai! Today I started the McNair scholars program, and now have to run off to a
class every monday and wednesday from 1:00 to 3:00 this summer. It's a
refreshing change of pace, but I feel like I'm missing out on glorious FOSSbox
time. I'll just have to make the most of the time that I do spend there from
now on. I will no longer play lemonade stand during my breaks! After all, I
already have a screenshot of [$1,000,000,000,000+](http://www.elsolet.net/wp-
content/uploads/2012/01/TRILJOEN.jpg), that's a trillion, also known as a
large waste of time.

Anyway, in a more progressive matter, I installed a school-server on an XO
laptop according to the instructions I mentioned previously,
"`wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing`" and it
was pretty cool. It would always load up straight to the [default terminal](ht
tp://oyster.ignimgs.com/planets/wiki/planetfallout.gamespy.com/default/uploads
/3/36/Fallout33234221.jpg) and log in as the root user. However, I couldn't
connect to it in the intended manner. I tried connecting it to my machine
through a router, but RITs network prevents other Access Points from existing
by sending out deauthentication packets from the network source. I imagine it
would be like opening a store only whenever a customer picks something up from
a shelf to buy it, it immediately turns into a sign saying "THIS IS NOT A
VALID PRODUCT, LEAVE NOW!!!!!"

*sigh* It's hard out there for a school server...
