Today was another productive day here at the FOSS. I added a bunch of new
creative events which was fun. Then I changed the events so that it gave a
little breathing room to get the game started before the events started
raining down to make impossible a little more playable. Then I spent some time
playing around with the changes to the events to see if I could polish them
out and make the game a little more balanced. I'm going to keep working on
that for now but to keep the project productive I'm going to have to
eventually say that it is fine as is, close the tickets, and start looking
into something new, probably working on the badges.
