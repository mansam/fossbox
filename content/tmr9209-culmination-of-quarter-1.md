Summary: Today we just completed the first quarter of the work we are doing for the summer. Over this quarter we did a lot of research on various components of game creation. From design components to game mechanics, we have researched several game types to understand the best way to implement Fedora achievements into a video game.

Today we just completed the first quarter of the work we are doing for the
summer. Over this quarter we did a lot of research on various components of
game creation. From design components to game mechanics, we have researched
several game types to understand the best way to implement Fedora achievements
into a video game. Using this data, we also made several charts and diagrams
to present the information to Red Hat.

In addition to the research that I learned specifically for Red Hat, I also
learned a lot that will help me in my own future. I gained vast amounts of
information that will help my game career. Game mechanics, open source
technologies, and game reviews are all various compilations of information at
the forefront of the industry. In addition to this, these two weeks have
allowed me to improve my skills. The research has been directed at innovative
open source concepts which have allowed me to improve my own innovative
skills. I have also improved my communication skills since doing research as a
team requires good communication to compile the information that we have
found.

Now that the research has reached Red Hat and that we have a good
understanding of the challenges we will face, I hope that we will progress
into the second stage of our research soon. This second stage will involve
making a plan to create the type of game Red Hat decides on. Looking back at
the research we have already done, I believe we are prepared for implementing
this stage.
