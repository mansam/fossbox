The count got a little mixed up over the weekend. The weekend was spent at a
National Day of Civic Hacking working on a small side project of mine called
Sky Time, and educational game about telling time for the XO laptops. Then
Monday I tried to get Sky Time packaged for the XO. Then today, the Tuesday
I'm just going to call Day 6 and just continue my count from there, in the
down time of work I finally figured out how to debug an Activity when I found
out there was a Log Activity that could track what there errors were. Sky Time
is now stable enough for its first release. Check the official Sky Time
website [www.playskytime.com](http://www.playskytime.com) for the release. My
official duties that I did was learn how to use git and vim, and then work on
prioritizing the wish list for Lemonade Stand.
