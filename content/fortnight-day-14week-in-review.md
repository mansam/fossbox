WOOOO!!!! This was our first full week at FOSSbox, exciting stuff!! Here's a
recap of what I've done:

## Day 10:

-> Days got mixed up, monday's entry was added into last [week's week in review post](http://foss.rit.edu/node/481)

## Day 11:

Marking Milestones

-> Issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-stand/issues)  
-->> I transferred over our list of "Core Requirements" and"Would be Nice-ties"  
-->> I also added in issues about or project with badges, adding info the XO Journals, and researching and implementing school servers  
-> TIL how to plan out projects on GitHub, and work on parts in separate branches

## Day 12:

Assignments and Ouya

-> Today we actually organized our issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-stand/issues)  
-->> We organized our issues into three trimesters  
-->> We allotted the issues from the first trimester out  
-> We discussed changes to the UI of Lemonade-Stand  
-> We also got to playtest the [ OUYA android gaming system](http://www.ouya.tv/)  
-> TIL Kickstarter funds many incredible projects, funding them will get you cool things for cheap!

## Day 13:

School Server Problems

-> In addition to our allotment of work on GIthub, we also got team roles  
-->> I'll be Community Lead - in charge of keeping good records of what we do  
-->> Other jobs are "Development Lead", "Tech lead" and "Game lead"  
-> We told the developers of school servers what we plan on doing with the software  
-> TIL It's quite frustrating to read up and try to work on something you don't physically have yet

## Day 14:

Work From Home Friday!

-> I rented out an XO from FOSSbox as well as an ethernet usb adapter.  
-> My plan was to Install sugar onto my tower and make it into an XO school server  
-->> My tower apparently thinks it's internal hard drives are external  
-->> Fedora can't be installed on external drives  
-> My hastily created backup plan was to make my Laptop into an XO school server  
-> I followed [this](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing) to the letter  
-->> My Laptop, whilst running sugar, only gave me a message saying, "Not an XO, please run 'xs-config'"  
-->> No other method calls including 'xs-config' existed, according to the terminal  
-> I didn't want to try doing it on the XO laptop without the FOSSbox's permission  
-> TIL Even with instructions, it's easy to bite off more than you can chew

P.S. I was going to add memes again, but quickmeme is down, but I'll start
making them daily as soon as it's back up! Day 14 would've had a FWP about not
getting free software to work on three different computers! *sigh*
