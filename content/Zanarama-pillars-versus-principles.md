Today in class we had a brief quiz on [Weber's Eight Principles](http://hfoss-
fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/books/Weber-SuccessofOpenSource-Chap3.pdf) and the
[Five Pillars of Open Source](http://opensource.com/open-source-way). Here is
my quiz:

What are the titles of each Pillar?

Open exchange

Participation

Rapid prototyping

Meritocracy

Community

What are the titles of each General Principle?

Make it interesting and make sure it happens

Scratch an itch

Minimize how many times you have to reinvent the wheel

Solve problems through parallel work processes whenever possible

Leverage the law of large numbers

Document what you do

Release early and release often

Talk a lot

What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles and the five
pillars?

Both focus practices of good open source projects by utilizing communication,
frequent releases and improvements, and large participation.

What are the differences?

The five pillars of open source are broad ideals to help guide the development
of FOSS. Weber's principles highlight both broad goals and specific goals that
must be met to achieve a successful project. For example, Weber's principle's
specifically highlight the importance of documentation and the qualitites of a
good open source leader.

I chose not to do the bonus, but for your own enjoyment you may want to
explore:

Who's "keen analysis" did Weber "Draw Heavily" upon?

What was the title of this "keen analysis." (Hint: Weber hinted at the title
when he was talking about Cathedrals earlier in the chapter.)

Where can this keen analysis be found?

Who knows, maybe I will answer them later.
