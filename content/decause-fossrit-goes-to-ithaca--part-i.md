Though Seneca county is only 2.5 hours away from Rochester, FOSS@RIT had yet
to interact with our neighbors to the southeast, that is until last week.
Through [Charles Profitt](), [I](http://twitter.com/#!/remy_d) was invited
along to attend [Ithaca's Education Technology
Day](http://ithaca.edu/edtechday) or EdTechDay for short. EdTechDay is a
gathering of education and technology professionals to meet, discuss, and
share stories and showcase best practices, hardware, and new tools. Of the
talks I attended, the "Discuss IT" tracks were the most informal and
conversational. I attended the sessions discussing the [New Media Consortium's
Horizon Report](http://nmc.org) and [Discuss IT...
Opensource](http://www.ithaca.edu/edtechday/seminars/).

[here](http://nmc.org/about))

> "The New Media Consortium (NMC) is an international not-for-profit
consortium of learning-focused organizations dedicated to the exploration and
use of new media and new technologies."
