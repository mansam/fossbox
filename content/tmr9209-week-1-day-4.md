Today we just finished up the rough drafts for the individual papers that
needed to be accomplished. In addition to this we did a bullet summary and a
chart for each question as well. The goal within the next day is to have the
information looked over for critique, then edit the document based on this
critique. Using this finished document it should be ready for Red Hat by the
end of the week.

For next week we plan on using our research to start solidifying the goals we
want accomplish from this game, the direction we want to take the game, and
the plan for how we want to progress in our work for the coming weeks.
