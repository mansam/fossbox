We are having a short work week this time because of the national holiday of
July 4th. We have a full FOSSbox of mentors, including some from Red Hat and a
Mozilla rep. Its quite the place to be hacking atm. On Monday, I was still
hacking on the Sash activity. This activity is going to be what the students
use to view their badges that they earn. If anyone wants to contribute to this
project, it's GitHub repo is located [Here](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/Sash).
I've gotten Sash to the point where it shows up on the XO properly with a
simple icon, but it only has dummy code in it so far. Also, I was presented
with the idea of making an activity Quick-start that could get a dev working
on a working activity without having to research how to make one from scratch.
This repo can be found here [Activity Quick
Start](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/Sugar_Activity_QuickStart.git). The
README.md file is a tutorial with some trouble shooting for posterity's sake.

Julython is in full swing. Julython is basically an event that tracks the
number of commits in the month of July. Check it out:
[Julython.org](http://www.julython.org/). I've been having some trouble with
getting myself to appear on the FOSS@RIT team so it counts my commits. I
believe that it is because I used a different address that wasn't hooked into
my GitHub account. After fixing this mix up, I'm just waiting for the site to
update to see if it registers my account correctly.

Next on the plate is working on cleaning up Sky-Time and adding the most
recent version to GitHub. After that I'm going to be working on sash to get
images to display correctly with all the metadata of a badge where it needs to
be. Ill still need to mock up how Sash is going to look and how it displays
badges. See you next time when we have some new works or complications!
