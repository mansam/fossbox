Now that the paper mock-ups have been made for Gourciferous I am starting to
port some of them to Glade to get an idea of how they will look once built. I
am also starting to look for feedback from Gource users so that we can create
the most intuitive GUI possible. I have looked into the Gource [Google
Code](http://code.google.com/p/gource/) page and
[Github](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) page and there is no real forum
or for general discussion. I would really like feedback from the Gource
community, I feel like opening an issue in Gource is not the right venue. I
have contacted Andrew Caudwell (the creator of Gource) introducing myself and
asking if there is a good place to go for feedback. Hopefully I will hear from
him soon!
