Today we just finished up our second day of play testing. Our goal over the
past two days was to play test social and MMORPG games so that we can get a
sense of the design and the best components of each to implement in our own
game. Some of the games that I play tested included Stronghold Kingdoms, WoW,
several Facebook games, and Starforge. I believe we now have a good handle on
the type of game we will be creating as well. Tomorrow we plan to answer
specific questions on the games we have been playing. To finish this week I
believe we will start the process of planning out the design of our own game
and how we will accomplish this design over the coming weeks.
