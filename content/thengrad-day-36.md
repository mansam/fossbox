Today was the local Rochester Python group meet up was today. Us
representative of Team [SkyTime](http://www.playskytime.com) who could make
this time went to present on the changes to SkyTime and how SkyTime is going
to the [White House](http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=50113). We then
listened to others as they gave talks on the projects they worked on.

What I worked on for today was cleaning up all the work I did for adding in
new ingredients, selecting recipes, and creating a custom recipe in game. Then
I'm going to stage the feature branch where I did all this work for being
merged back into the develop branch if the rest of the group approves of my
changes.
