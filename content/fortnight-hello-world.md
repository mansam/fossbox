Hello, my name is Fernando Axel Ellis. This summer I'll be working through the
RIT FOSSbox on open Badges in the Lemonade Stand program for the XO Laptop. I
wanted to work with the FOSSbox at RIT this summer to gain a firm grasp on
planning a computer programming project for a small team as well as following
through with said plans. I plan to work on many open source software projects
in the future and I hope to gain a foothold on the structure of the community.
