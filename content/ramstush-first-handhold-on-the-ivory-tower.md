Hey Everyone,

I'm finally back after quite some time (a couple months or so). Upcoming for
my blog will be posts concerning a New Media Team Project (ditto to a
Educational Capstone) and a variety of different Raspberry Pi projects pumping
out of the Advanced FOSS course. All in all, there's going to be some sweet
hacks getting built and produced. I'll make sure to get some team support in
putting these on Github for the internets. Until then, I'll keep updating this
blog as the new knowledge flows in.
