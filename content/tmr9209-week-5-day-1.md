Today we started by narrowing down our setting choices. I thought our progress
was interesting because we went from a standstill to quick progress.
Basically, ideas kept getting thrown around that was making us go off topic
and become unfocused. Eventually we decided to take a step back and remodel
each of our topics, looking directly at the setting components. Once we did
this our progression soared and we accomplished a lot. We now have three solid
setting ideas, one of them at the forefront so that we can progress forward.

The other major thing we started working on was researching how to paper
prototype our game. Paper prototypes are crucial to make sure a game is fun
and that the mechanics work appropriately. I found one good article that
explains the process very well and also got a lot of information from one of
AJ's books.
