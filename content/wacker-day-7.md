Summary: Today was a long and extensive day of digging through the interent and all sugar directories on our system's to find any information about the XO and how it communicates with the XS, which is the School Server for XO laptops. We were able to find a link that talks about [datastore](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore) and how to create new data objects.

Today was a long and extensive day of digging through the interent and all
sugar directories on our system's to find any information about the XO and how
it communicates with the XS, which is the School Server for XO laptops. We
were able to find a link that talks about
[datastore](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore) and how to
create new data objects. I found one
[link](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Copy_to_and_from_the_Journal) that talks
about how to read and write to and from the journal.

Then we decided to dig through a bunch of files to look for any source code
that had to do with school servers or journals. We found some information, but
nothing that was substantial. We will continue diving into research and try to
find more info about how these things communicate to one another so we can
begin some intense hacking.
