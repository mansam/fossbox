Today I believe we really took goods steps towards heading our project in the
right direction. Meetings with SJ and communication on mechanics we want to
implement has allowed us to gain a better sense of where we want our project

and completed a lot of work for sending out the e-mails to technology groups.
In addition to this, I specifically also started working on getting a group

some stress from not knowing how our game will be proceeding.
