Summary: Today I managed to get a semi-working mockup of a tabs widget that could be used to display information about NY state senators. Each collapsible tab contains a category of information such as bill sponsored by that senator, committees they are a member of, contact information, etc. Hopefully the coolest part of this will be a calendar widget embedded in one of the tabs, to store events relating to the senator.

Today I managed to get a semi-working mockup of a tabs widget that could be
used to display information about NY state senators. Each collapsible tab
contains a category of information such as bill sponsored by that senator,
committees they are a member of, contact information, etc. Hopefully the
coolest part of this will be a calendar widget embedded in one of the tabs, to
store events relating to the senator. This part is not functional yet; right
now I put up a very basic calendar as a placeholder. Rebecca and I have been
researching various jQuery calendars and I think one with more functionality
(maybe tooltip lists of events?) would be better suited for this.

For bill information, the goal is to pull that information from the senate's
RSS feed, but I'm still a little confused as to how to connect the Python code
that will do this to the HTML templates. Time to do more research on
TurboGears!
