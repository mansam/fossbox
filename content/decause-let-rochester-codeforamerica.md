Summary: In our campaign, we do as much as we can with whatever we are afforded, and then give all the code away for Free regardless. Affording sponsorship to developers, and opening those kind of positive feedback loops, is a vision too few share.  From one campaign built upon code and coders to another, I would like to apply not for your [fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/apply), but for Rochester to be included in your list of available cities.

In our campaign, we do as much as we can with whatever we are afforded, and
then give all the code away for Free regardless. Affording sponsorship to
developers, and opening those kind of positive feedback loops, is a vision too
few share.

From one campaign built upon code and coders to another, I would like to apply
not for your [fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/apply), but for Rochester
to be included in your list of available cities. We want to run this campaign
--or one very much like it--at Rochester Institute of Technology, in the City
of Rochester, New York, using our [CIVX](http://civx.us) campaign and platform
to demonstrate how the tools we've helped build can close tickets and open
datasets.

We'll be participating in the [CapitolCamp](http://capitolcamp.org) [Developer
Day](http://capitolcampdev.eventbrite.com) on August 19th, helping others
utilize and widgetize the NYS Seante's [open data and
API's](http://nysenate.gov/open). We will then present the fruits of the
Hackfests' (as well as our Summer Semester's) labor at the [CapitolCamp
Unconference](http://capitolcamp.eventbrite.com) next week, August 20th.

Please regard our sentiments as genuine. This campaign is not just a "good
idea," but a living breathing open source project. We are not contacting you
because we need help getting started, but because we've already covered much
ground. Our initial research grant has been expended, and we are about to show
people the result of academics, government staffers, journalists, and
developers, sitting at one table together, with a little bit of grant money, a
little bit of time, and a little bit of code.

Imagine what could be done with a lot more code,

--RemyD.
