As I was repairing my code so that it would work properly with the changes
within develop I noticed there were a bunch of places where making a tiny
mistake in the customizing of the stand would crash the whole game. Some of
these things I had fixed in the develop branch but someone unfixed them. So
after repairing my code and making sure it that it met the [pep8
standards](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) I went through and
strengthened all the weak spots in Lemonade Stand that I noticed. Now someone
has to make some seriously obvious mistakes in customizing the stand before
the game will crash as long as somebody doesn't remove the fortifications I
put in again.
