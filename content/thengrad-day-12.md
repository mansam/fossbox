Today Casey, one of the people working here for the summer as part of the
Google Summer of Code, brought in an Ouya. We took this opportunity to try it
and some of the games for it out. We played:

  * [Monocle Man](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/105-monocle-man), a puzzle game
  * [Garnatron ](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/124-garnatron), a vertical space shooter
  * [God of Blades](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/19-god-of-blades), a side scrolling sword fighting game
  * [Polarity](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/112-polarity), a first person puzzle game
  * [A Bit of A Fist of Awesome](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/49-a-bit-of-a-fist-of-awesome), a beat'em up
  * [Flashout 3D](http://www.ouyactu.com/applis-jeux/119-flashout-3d), a racing game

While playing these games I was paying attention to the interface and how
these games taught the player the game to try and get ideas on how the UI of
Lemonade Stand could be improved.

Team Lemonade Stand also got together to design the layout of the new scene we
were adding in to split up the wall of text that would seem overwhelming to
children.
