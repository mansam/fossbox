[ Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org) is a global grassroots movement
of active and empowered entrepreneurs who are learning the basics of founding
startups and launching successful ventures. It is the largest community of
passionate entrepreneurs with over 400 past events in 100 countries around the
world in 2011.

The non-profit organization is headquartered in Seattle, Washington but
Startup Weekend organizers and facilitators can be found in over 200 cities
around the world. From Mongolia to South Africa to London to Brazil, people
around the globe are coming together for weekend long workshops to pitch
ideas, form teams, and start companies.

All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to
pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams
organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then
itâ€™s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and
market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local
entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.

Whether entrepreneurs found companies, find a cofounder, meet someone new, or
learn a skill far outside their usual 9-to-5, everyone is guaranteed to leave
the event better prepared to navigate the chaotic but fun world of startups.
