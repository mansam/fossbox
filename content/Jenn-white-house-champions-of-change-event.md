AWESOME NEWS!!!

Sky Time was accepted to be represented in the White House Champions of Change
Event!

“White House Champions of Change events feature groups of Americans –
individuals, businesses, and organizations – who are doing extraordinary
things to empower and inspire members of their communities.”

I spent a very long time on the application, and I hoped a lot, but I did not
expect it to actually happen. Even after I started telling people, I had a
moment of panic when I thought the acceptance letter was sent to me by
mistake.

I will be going to DC and the White House!!! It hardly sounds real. Needless
to say I am thrilled!

I am so thankful of Ryan Stush, Ian Furry, and David Wilson for programing,
creating, and improving on Sky Time!!! Thank you guys for all your hard work!
Remy, thank you so much for your feedback on the application essays!
