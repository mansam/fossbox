We've now officially completed week 3, a.k.a. the first summer cycle. Things
are looking bright for CIVX!

This past week I again modified my person dashboard to get information about
actions and votes from the Open Legislation API. I'm still trying to figure
out the best way to get contact information and committee membership by
senator, but that is the last hurdle before the widget gets all of its tabs'
info dynamically. I am moving the widget itself from the quickstart project I
created to a local instance of CIVX on my computer - pretty sweet to actually
see the "behind the scenes" of CIVX.

Also, Rebecca and I got to show off some cool jQuery magic we created during
eVanhee meetings this week - props to her for the excellent timeline and
slider widgets. My contribution was the Img Notes plugin I mentioned in a
previous post, with some prettification done by Rebecca. They all seemed to go
over well, and I'm excited to see them in action with the energy savings data.

Be sure to tune in to WXXI tomorrow from 6-9am to hear [Remy
D](http://foss.rit.edu/user/1) announce the CIVX Advisory Board!
