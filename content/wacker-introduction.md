Hello! My name is David Wilson and I am a 3rd year pursuing a BS in Game
Design and Development as well as a minor in Computer Science.

I am working with a RIT Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) team
implementing the Mozilla Open Badges into Lemonade Stand on the XO Laptop of
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC). We are doing this in a modular way, so that our
work can be integrated into other activities and games on the XO.

I would love to get great team building skills and experience on larger scale
projects like this one, more exposure and work with FOSS, and working with
Linux. This project will be a huge stepping stone in my programming career and
grant me knowledge that will help me in more projects to come in the future. I
am looking forward to a great summer filled of learning and new experiences!

Here is my GitHub account where I will be posting all of my work.
