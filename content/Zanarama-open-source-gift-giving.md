As I have been browsing various websites to find some cool gifts to give
people, I came across a couple of really cool open source gifts.

**[The Whistled](https://www.tindie.com/products/limpkin/the-whistled-control-your-lights-by-whistling/?pt=directsearch)** is a device that allows you to control a set of LED lights by whistling two notes. It also is a great example of an Open Hardware project!

**[Skill Badges](http://www.adafruit.com/category/70)** are a really cool way to highlight skills that someone already has or to gain a new skill and reward yourself, I mean somebody else, with a cool badge.

**[RedBot Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12032)** is an Arduino powered robot that is completely Open Source. It can use a lot of interesting sensors and I think would be a great gift for someone just getting into Arduino.

Anyway, Happy Holidays!
