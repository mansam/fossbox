I today trying to close one of the tickets for Lemonade Stand. The ticket
asked for a version of lemonade stand with strawberries and ice. Strawberries
were already somewhat in the game but commented out, but I had to create ice
from scratch, getting all new images from FOSS@RIT's resident artist. After
that I customized the recipes and added some new events to help fully

noticed that even though I changed the recipe the game was still selling only
the basic lemonade.
