# Hopefully last day of reading up about school Servers

As I mentioned on day 12, we planned out when our issues would have to be
dealt with by, as well as who has to solve which issue.

All this can be seen here: [HERE!!!!](https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-
stand/issues)

Click on any issue to see a more detailed explanation of what it entails, or
filter by milestone to see when things are due.

In addition to that I have been named "Community Lead" of the project, where
as my teammates RAMstush, DAWacker, and Thengrad are Badges lead, Tech lead,
and Game lead, respectively. I hope I got those right. My job entails keeping
records of whatever happens so that future developers have explicitly detailed
stores of information to turn to about what we accomplished here; I wouldn't
anyone else to be as [in the
dark](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/In-the-dark.svg) as
we were.

Speaking of being in the dark, however, I have also been assigned to get our
processes regarding school-servers for the XOs up and running and spent all of
today reading up about them. We also got to be in on a skype call with the
leading developers of the XSCE - [XO Server Community
Edition](wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3) - who are
responsible for the recent 0.3 release. Aside from that I got fed up about
only reading up on and hearing about the XO school servers without having one,
I will try to take things into my own hands and install one on my computer as
I work from home on day 14, our first "Work From Home Friday."

Wish me Luck!
