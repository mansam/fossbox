So a new week has begun and we are still getting rotation to work. We have a
few ideas and supposedly JT got pretty far on it last Thursday but, with me
not being in the FOSS Box that day, we were not able to truly work together.
He has not come in yet but will probably be here soon and thus we will be able
to bang out this final piece of the "puzzle". Beyond that we will also be
working on integrating our system with Jlew's game engine today. We are
scheduled to have a meeting sometime today on how they can work together.
Hopefully we won't run into too many issues but I will not be surprised if we
do. Well that's all there really is to say for now so I guess I will see you
next time.
