Summary: **Monday: Finishing up Menu Screens**   ... 

**Monday: Finishing up Menu Screens**  
-Finished navigation and functionality of the main menu screen  
-Finished navigation and functionality of the difficulty screen and its effects with elements within the game  
-Finished navigation and functionality of the tutorial screen, still needs info text

**Tuesday: New Menu UI Live**  
-Finished adding info text to each screen in the tutorial  
-Implemented a basic challenge mode with an end condition. The end condition is completing one summer which is currently defined as 90 days.  
-Began talk about implementing a badge display activity on the [XO Laptop](http://one.laptop.org/) for all of the current user's badges

**Wednesday: Dynamic and Localized Game**  
-Met with our awesome mentor, Stephen Jacobs, and began talking about implementing a new dynamic feel to Lemonade Stand  
--This dynamic feel meant loading in different images for the game such as a hamburger or ice cream stand to give the game more customization and a more dynamic feel for players  
-Created [a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/issues/24) which I also assigned to myself and began on implementing a dynamic way of loading information for Lemonade Stand.

**Thursday: Reputation and Locations**  
-Began implementing reputation which a player can either gain or lose depending on how well they did on that specific day.  
-Reputation influences that amount of people that show up to your stand per day which also determines how many people you can sell to.  
-Reputation in itself helps balance the game by not allowing players to accumulate an absurd amount of money within the first few days  
-Locations allow users to move their stand to a different area which can also influence how many customers will show up to your stand  
-Locations have their own specific amount of reputation.  
-Locations have their own customer cap  
-Locations have their own amount of money that the player must spend to rent it for the day, but with a rent price comes significant rewards 

**Friday: Ice Cream Stand Implemented**  
-Received images from our amazing artist [Jenn](http://foss.rit.edu/blog/6426) which were of ingredients for creating an ice cream from our ice cream stand!  
-Implemented a way to dynamically load in images and text to fit for different types of stands  
-Successfully implemented Ice Cream stand and can easily switch back to Lemonade stand by changing a single attribute within the game
