So far, so good. Seven pull requests, and even a pull request to the core

No class today, as RIT is closed for Labor Day (for the first time, like,
ever) so we've had to cancel our special Guest Lecture from Lmacken. That
being said, we'll get him in on a video lecture at some point later in the
quarter.

I am *pumped* for Wednesday's Git Seminar, and getting some input from the
students who were the first to complete the assignment. Reminder: The
Literature Review for Chapter 3 of Steven Weber's _The Success of Open Source_
will be due on Monday of next week.

Happy Hacking,
