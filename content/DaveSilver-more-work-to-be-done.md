On top of this we had our first real discussion with JLew about how the final animation system will work.

So yesterday was hands down the most productive day I have had all summer. I
got a large portion of my test environment for the sprite sheets done and I
learned a whole bunch of stuff that pertains to how JT and I will do our final
animation system. On top of this we had our first real discussion with JLew
about how the final animation system will work.

The conversation was mostly productive but at the beginning we were definitely
just talking at each other because neither of us really knew what the other
was trying to say(or at least it seemed that way to me). Once we got past that
phase though and started understanding what each other was saying, we made
some good progress.

So today I am hopefully finishing up my test environment for sprite sheets. I
don't really have much left to do but I may get distracted with more
conversations and stiuff. In any case I will blog more later. Se you then.
