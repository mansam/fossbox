Summary: My first week at the FOSSBox has already been a series of new experiences and opportunities. I am running [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) for the first time (and loving it!), I began working on my first open source project for Red Hat, and I attended my first (civic) hackathon.  For this first week a lot of time was spent setting up my laptop and the many accounts that I needed, and registered to attend and to give a 45 minute talk about my Gource project at [Flock to Fedora](http://flocktof ... 

My first week at the FOSSBox has already been a series of new experiences and
opportunities. I am running [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) for the first
time (and loving it!), I began working on my first open source project for Red
Hat, and I attended my first (civic) hackathon.

For this first week a lot of time was spent setting up my laptop and the many
accounts that I needed, and registered to attend and to give a 45 minute talk
about my Gource project at [Flock to Fedora](http://flocktofedora.org/).
Hopefully I will be selected to speak, but no matter what I am really looking
forward to (hopefully) attending. I haven't been using Fedora on my laptop for
very long but I am becoming a huge fan and I love the open source culture. I
think attending the conference will help me meet a lot of new people and start
to become more a part of the Fedora community.

As a way to start contributing more to the open source community and learn
more about how projects get started, I attended my first hackathon this
weekend at RIT for the first National Day of Civic Hacking. The hackathon went
from 3pm Saturday to 3pm Sunday for a full 24 hours of hacking on projects for
the good of our community. I was able to work on an awesome project called
[Food Desert Mapper](https://github.com/JHKennedy4/FoodDesertMapper), created
by [John Kennedy](https://github.com/JHKennedy4), a very recent RIT graduate.
Food Desert Mapper is an application for crowd sourcing data on the
availability of certain food staples at stores that accept
[SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap) benefits in order to determine "food
deserts" or areas where obtaining these staples with SNAP benefits is
difficult or impossible. You can see live project
[here](http://www.foodmapper.us/), so be sure to check it out.

John Kennedy had already started the project during his last year at RIT, but
was kind enough to catch us up and help us contribute to the project. I mostly
worked on new styling for the markers on the map, implementing
[AwesomeMarkers](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers) instead
of the default CartoDB
