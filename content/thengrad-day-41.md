Summary: Just crossed my fingers and hoped that what I ended up submitting to develop wasn't complete broken and ruin the code for everyone. But I was asked to drop the code set up as many of the XOs as I could so that we could go to on a field trip and teach young minds about free and open source programming.

Just crossed my fingers and hoped that what I ended up submitting to develop
wasn't complete broken and ruin the code for everyone. But I was asked to drop
the code set up as many of the XOs as I could so that we could go to on a
field trip and teach young minds about free and open source programming. So
while my group was busy and I couldn't set up Lemonade Stand on my own because
I didn't know at all how the code they put in to translated worked or why it
was giving me an error I tried to set up SkyTime first. Then it turned out
that the version in the repository was not only incomplete but also giving me
the same problem with the translation file i broke down and pestered my group
for help. While they were fixing their mess I checked that each XO I found was
fully charged and worked. Then I tried to get the amazing turtle project to
work on XO which turned out to be a nightmare since the version of python
installed on the machines didn't come with the tkinter package by default. So
I was trying to play around with it so that we wouldn't have to install
tkinter on each machine individually and set up a special environment for each
kid every time. So far I don't have any ideas that worked.
