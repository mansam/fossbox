Summary: Today we each developed a setting that our game would take place in. The goal was to come up with logical settings that would work with our mechanics and FOSS integration we plan on implementing. We also decided on a final setting, which became a mesh of my, Francis's, and David's setting ideas. We also went through the setting again to make sure that this final setting would work with all of the FOSS integration. Finally, we came up with some concept art for this final setting as well.

Today we each developed a setting that our game would take place in. The goal
was to come up with logical settings that would work with our mechanics and
FOSS integration we plan on implementing. We also decided on a final setting,
which became a mesh of my, Francis's, and David's setting ideas. We also went
through the setting again to make sure that this final setting would work with
all of the FOSS integration. Finally, we came up with some concept art for
this final setting as well.

Today was also the first meeting with the other researchers throughout the
college to guide us for the symposium presentation at the end of the research.
They had us explain what we have been completing with other researchers to get
us prepared for our presentations. I personally met to other people working on
other projects. One individual was researching North American otters and find
out "what they see" through experiments such as matching objects together. The
other researcher was looking into combining biodegradable materials with the
poly-carbonate of plastic bags to make them more biodegradable. This
experience has allowed me to see the viewpoints of other researchers and has
opened doors to my own research.
