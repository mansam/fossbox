Today we sat around and discussed what we were going to put into tickets and
things that we could combine or separate. We spent most of the day doing this
as well as some heavy research into the school servers. I was digging for
information about adding code to have [Lemonade
Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) talk to the Jounral in the
XO so the information about Lemonade Stand could be backed on the school
server.

I found a handy dandy [notebook](http://en.flossmanuals.net/make-your-own-
sugar-activities/fun-with-the-journal/) that served as a great reference with
any questions I had about sugar activities thanks to friends in the IRC #sugar
channel :)
