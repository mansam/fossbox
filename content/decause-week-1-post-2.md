Summary: The FOSSBox is picking up again :) I love when we have foss courses running, as it brings much more traffic through the lab. We're also in the process of bringing in another part-time hire to help with FOSS@RIT/LTL projects.

The FOSSBox is picking up again :) I love when we have foss courses running,
as it brings much more traffic through the lab. We're also in the process of
bringing in another part-time hire to help with FOSS@RIT/LTL projects. We
spent the afternoon going over the basics of git, and some of the projects
that Robb will likely be working on this quarter.

I've also hopped on the [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) bandwagon, and created a
new blog. It is inherently social, and easy to follow others with, which is a
big plus from a social media perspective, but what I *really* like about it is
that it allows for custom CSS and HTML posting. It allows you to use pretty
much whatever CSS you like, and even allows things like iframes (I know...
iframes are bad...)

I will be working on the skin more in the future, but for now, it is simple
and very system-esque [http://decause.tumblr.com](http://decause.tumblr.com)

The next couple days I will be diving back into chapter-writing land, and
cranking on my chapter for the upcoming "World of Cybercrime" book series. I'm
looking forward to checking off "become a published author" from the bucket
list :) In the meantime though, I will continue hating my life, and cranking
on my 30+ pages of licensing, copyright, and opensource in the context of
cybercrime and intellectual property.

Wish me luck folks,

--RemyD.
