The day I had been waiting for, [Lemonade Day!](http://lemonadeday.org/) The
team and myself travelled to Henry Hudson Elementary School in Rochester.
There we set up a table for us to display the four XOs that we had, two of
which we playing [Lemonade Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand)
and the other two [Sky Time](http://www.playskytime.com/).

The day was a great success! We were able to go around and see other Lemonade
tables around the school and try some of their delicious goods. I was able to
pick up some fresh raspberry lemonade made with fresh fruit! I was blown away
at how delicious this was. As for out table, we attracted many kids to test
both of our games which we were able to gather a lot of useful feedback and
information from all the children. We kept a list of everything and quickly
thought of ways of how we could implement all this feedback. All of this
information with be created into tickets the next week and divided up wihtin
the team to who will tackle who.
