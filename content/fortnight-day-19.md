# Fear of Failure

Yay! today is Work from home friday!!!! However, it is also the start of my
discontent. Today marks one week that I have tried and failed to implement a
school server. I only have a week left to [close the
ticket](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/issues/2). This is quite
worrysome for me as I was the one who wrote up most of the tickets for the
project, and assumed the role of community lead. With no one in my home to
seek guidance or confidence from, I tried, unsuccessfully, to just forget
about my worries by digging through the code I found on [day
18](http://foss.rit.edu/node/523). If you have done as I have done and
attempted to install a school server on an XO as they have described here: [ht
tp://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing](http://
wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing), then code
documents I was going to look through can be found in the following
directories:

/bin/xs-setup-functions

/bin/xs-setup

/bin/xs-setup-network

/bin/xs-domain-config

/bit/bootstrap-xo/

/bootpart/security/state/etc/ssh/sshd_config

/etc/rssh

/etc/rc

/etc/sysctl

/etc/sysconfig/olps-scripts/domain_config,d

/var/log

/etc/rsyslog.conf

/etc/sysctl.conf

/etc/ssh/sshd_config

/etc/rssh.conf

/home/root/.bash_history

/usr/share/xs-config/plugins.d

/var/log/xs-setup.log

/usr/share.xs-config/cfg

I have been taking notes on my computer, but will very soon post what I have
understood about them and the methods therein on an EtherPad for all to see.
As this is a long list of notes, I was fighting a losing battle against my
procrastinatory and failure-ready past self, and only finished going through
an embarrassingly small amount of code. I was not paying attention to my
laptop when [FOSSmaster decause](https://github.com/decause) called a roll-
call to see who was in channel. being in IRC chat is one-third of the
necessary trifecta of Work-From-Home-Fridays, the other two being blogging and
Tickets. I'm working on this ticket, but have no proof other than the blogs,
but that will soon change when I whip out the aforementioned EtherPad. It
would seem setting up a school server will require to understand it's
processes thoroughly.
