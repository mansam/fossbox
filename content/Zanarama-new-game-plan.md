Working with sensors has not been going so well. I overestimated my skill in
being able to interface with sensors. I can get the data using an Arduino, but
when I have tried to use the Measure code, I cannot get it to work. In order
to accomplish most of the project goals on time, we are pushing the sensors
onto the back burner. For now, we will be focusing on recording the weather
and saving it in the journal. If I have time I am still going to try to get
the sensors working. Only time will tell.
