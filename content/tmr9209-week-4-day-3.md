Today we did a lot more towards sending out the tech e-mails. We went through
and revamped our questions. Now each technology that we plan on getting
feedback from has two solid questions in addition to four others from our
question pool. Presently, they are awaiting final approval to send out from
Remy and SJ. The goal is to send out e-mails and make contact early tomorrow
morning.

We also began looking into various game combat systems that our game could
use. There were several good ideas tossed around that I thought was pretty
cool. Interestingly, some of our ideas overlapped. Using these combat systems,
we can get closer to narrowing down our game in the future.
