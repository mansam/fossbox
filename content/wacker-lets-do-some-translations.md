For the past week I have been hacking on [Lemonade
Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand) changing all of our hard
coded text into dynamic text for loading in different dynamic sets of stands.
While doing this, I have changed all the text to
[gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) to be able to translate the
game into Spanish as well as other languages. Currently, we have a [Spanish
version](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/tree/feature/spanish) of
Lemonade Stand working.

Similar to Lemonade Stand, I finished working on [Sky
Time](http://playskytime.com/) and changed all of our text to gettext and is
ready to be translated for a Spanish version. This should be up and running
within the next day or two.
