So it is the beginning of week 2. This week JT and I plan on finishing up the
final test for the animation frame rates. In this final test we have multiple

for us. This new version really simplifies the process and is pretty easy to
add more functionality to. Once the test is complete we will move into testing
scalability of images and the best ways to scale images. We don't currently
know exactly how we will test scalability but I have some ideas and it should
not be vary hard for us to implement the tests.
