Start: 04/19/2012 - 12:00am

Timezone: US/Eastern

The 140 Characters Conference: Syracuse will be taking place on April 19, 2012
in Schine Student Center, on the campus of Syracuse University.

**Our very own Remy DeCausemaker will be giving a talk at 3:15pm entitled "Social Coding and Civic Hacking."**

#140cuse will expose you to the power the real-time web has to disrupt
businesses, change lives and create serendipity. You will leave with a fresh
outlook on how the real time web can be used in your business and/or personal
life to do something meaningful.

Prepare to laugh, connect and learn as each of our “characters” shares
authentic stories about how this new medium has affected their lives. Our
eclectic group of speakers may be using the real time web differently but
their stories all share one thing in common…how the real-time web is changing
our lives.

The #140cuse events provide a platform for the worldwide twitter community to:
listen, connect, share and engage with each other, while collectively
exploring the effects of the emerging real-time internet on business.

Our schedule is unique and fast paced. It is our intention to provide a
platform for as many people as possible to share their thoughts and engage in
conversation with the attending delegates. You will find individual talks set
to 10 minutes; and the various panel discussions are set for 10 or 20 minutes.

The take-aways from this event will provide the attending delegates knowledge,
perspectives and insights to the effects the real-time internet will have on
both “we” the people, business and society.
