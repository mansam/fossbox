Today we continued working on the high concept and treatment documents. Their
first draft is almost completely done. All that is left are a few sections
which need to be reworked and Oddshock's tech information that needs to be
added. To get to this stage, we had to go through a few more discussions so
that we had a very good understanding about what the game will be like. This
involved finalizing the money, crafting, and trading materials that are game
will use. We also had to finalize how player versus player will work within
our game. Finally, we went through all of the FOSS integration that we had
brainstormed and finalized what we would like to use within the game.
