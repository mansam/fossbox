**Monday: Base Implementation**  
- I was able to get some new artwork from our amazing artist [Jenn!](http://foss.rit.edu/blog/6426) I received the new screen for the profit mini game.  
- I began hocking up the new mini game screen to appear only if the player made any profit  
- Finished cleaning out the day logs

**Tuesday: Finishing Touches**  
- Started throwing together the finishing functionality of the mini game screen allowing users to select different types of money and having the mini game read input correctly  
- Finished alignment after testing the new screen on the XO Laptop

**Wednesday: New UI is Live**  
- Pushed the new UI and day log changes to our [GitHub develop branch](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/tree/develop) for Lemonade Stand.  
- Closed my first two [tickets on GItHub!](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/issues?milestone=6&state=closed) This was really exciting for me!  
- Assigned three new [tickets](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/issues/assigned/DAWacker?milestone=7&page=1&state=open) to myself regarding menu and difficulty screen and settings.  
- Had a little chit chat with our artist Jenn again about the menu and difficulty screen

**Thursday: Implementing Menu and Difficulty Screen**  
- Implemented the Menu and Difficulty screen to appear and draw correctly in the game  
- No major functionality for the menu options but was able to start the game from the menu and play normally  
- Difficulty options on the other hand were implemented and changing the difficulty according to the one chosen  
- Meeting with the team about how and what each difficulty would affect the gameplay

**Friday: Implementing Difficulty in Gameplay**  
- Implemented prices changes for items and starting money depending on what difficulty setting is chosen  
- Implemented the tutorial option in the menu to show a quick slide of images of how to play  
- [Ryan](http://foss.rit.edu/blog/41940), one of our team members, has been trying to solve the mystery of Lemonade Stand not writing to the journal and today finally solved it! He was able to get Lemonade Stand to finally write to the Journal on the XO Laptops! It was a great way to wrap up the week.

I have attached some images of the new UI and menu/difficulty screens!
