Success! We will be at Imagine RIT in FOSS Box in the Innovation Center!

The download is not quite ready yet, but should be up shortly!

This week we rethought the interface and user interaction with the keyboard.
At Ryanâ€™s suggestion we are now using the shift keys to move the clock hands.
This allows the player to use both hands comfortably. We also have some plans
for positive reinforcement with animation of clock hands when the student gets
an answer correct. (For now we just have an image that pops up)
