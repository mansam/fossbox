Summary: This previous Thursday, the Lemonade Stand team had quite a hard time at work.

This previous Thursday, the Lemonade Stand team had quite a hard time at work.
It was our job that day to research sugar XO laptops communicated with a
school server, with regards to the Journal. The
[Journal](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal_Activity) is an activity that
records a list of activities that have been accessed throughout time. Sort of
like the history on a web browser. Students have an option of adding tags to
these entries to show what they learned while using that particular activity.
We searched and searched and searched but couldn't find anything worthwhile in
the superficial sites we found. This was perhaps the most exhausting day we
will ever have at our Co-Op because we used up so many resources while getting
absolutely no returns...

As a last ditch effort I contacted Walter Bender asking if he knew anything
(or anyone) about sugar school servers. As soon as we declare the day over, I
get an email back outlining that there are a couple people who know about
servers in the #sugar chat room in IRC. After this day, I just needed a break
to rest my brain..
