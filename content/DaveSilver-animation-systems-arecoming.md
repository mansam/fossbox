So as of last night the animation systems are in a pretty good place. I have
most of it done and am moving on to the final piece today. Overall things are
going pretty well with it so far. The rotation stuff is still giving us
problems but we have decided to put it on hold until we have everything else
complete. This way we will not be held up by it and fall behind schedule. I
expect that once we get away from the problem and stop thinking so much about
it we will come up with a solution because that's just how these things tend
to go but who knows. In any case, things are going well, and we are still
pretty much on schedule to complete the whole of the system by Friday night.
Talk to you next time.
