Summary: Tomorrow evening marks the first day of [Rosh Hashanah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) (Happy New Year!) and the middle of the second week of classes so I thought should probably write a blog post to talk about the classes of the new year....

Tomorrow evening marks the first day of [Rosh
Hashanah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) (Happy New Year!) and
the middle of the second week of classes so I thought should probably write a
blog post to talk about the classes of the new year....

This is a pretty exciting semsester (my first college semester) because almost
all of my classes are academically relevant to my major. Other than a
Chemistry course I am taking, every class is a computer related course:
Applied Programming, Computer Organization, Electronics I, and of course the
[Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software](http://hfoss-
fossrit.rhcloud.com/) (HFOSS) course! In addition, I am a TA for two Computer
Engineering classes, Introduction to Computer Engineering and Digital System
Design I. It is my first time being a TA and I am really excited to start.

The group of students I am with for the HFOSS course seem nice. Right now it
is a little slow for me because I learned a lot of this over the summer. It is
nice to feel knowledgeable and be able to help people in the class though. I
am a little out of my element because almost everybody is a Game Design major.
Hopefully this won't put me too far behind once we start actual projects. We
shall see as the semester goes on!
