Hello All,

As a new member of FOSS @ RIT, I would like to introduce myself as well as
describe the current research I have been tasked with. My name is Robb Krasnow
and I am a graduate student here at RIT studying my Master's of Science in
Information Technology. My two (and potentially three) concentrations are Web
design and development, system administration, and computer networking. I love
technology and have just started using Open Source software on my laptop
(don't worry, I will graduate from Ubuntu soon).

My first project here with FOSS is to help research, design, and develop a
Microsoft Just Press Play Website. This Website will be a real-time debate of
historical documents that will move the highest ranking topics to the top of
the site. Participants will be able to argue a central items validity and rank
other users and comments. Today was my first day of research on how to best
implement this Website and I have come across some examples of real-time
Websites, as well as some potential technologies we can implement. When I have
a more complete list, I will be posting that here, so keep your eyes open.

If anyone has any questions for me, feel free to Email me: rgk8573 at rit dot
edu

Glad to be a part of the team!
