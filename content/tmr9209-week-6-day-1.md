Today was a good work day in that we got a lot nailed down, plus planned out
the next one or two weeks. We mainly did this with our meeting with SJ, in
which we concluded that this week will be devoted to finalizing the design,
setting, concept, and a basic understanding of the FOSS integratione we plan
on implementing. As we finalize these things, we also be writing several
drafts of the Concept Document and the Treatment Document to display a good,
precise overview of our game. From these, we can begin the prototyping and
playtesting process.

Today we started the first draft of the Concept Document, worked on the story
and setting components, and brainstormed several very good ways to implement
FOSS data into our game.
