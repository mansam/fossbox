The first thing I did today was make my code more pep-8 compliant by changing
over global variables to local variables wherever present and making use of
lists. All images are now converted to an easy to manipulate format for easier

modified magic menu to have access to the list of which spell glyphs the
player has got correct so far. Next is getting these to show up in the correct
spots, and making the right functions match with the right buttons.

OVC + Fortune Hunter are going to Boston next week: [http://foss.rit.edu/event
