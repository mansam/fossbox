It is now the end of the fifth week of this summer research program. It is
quickly approaching crunch time. All of the deadlines are now looming over our
heads. With that being said Lemonade Stand is looking really good so far. I’ve
put a lot of work into balancing the game through changes made to the event. I
spent the early part of the week messing around with the way events got
created, even added a delay that for all days before day five would end the
function before an event was created and also that a negative event wouldn’t
display if the amount of items was already at zero, and the different events
there were in the game. Then I fiddled with the numbers and fixed a bunch of
bugs that appeared because I was adding in completely new logic that didn’t
merge perfectly with the logic that is was originally created with. Then I
messed around with the amount the cups were sold for when I noticed in play
testing you sell cups for half of what the ingredients cost on the impossible
difficulty setting. Then for the end of the week I’ve been working on a way to
choose different recipes at the end of the day. This has been a tough nut to
crack since I haven’t been sure on how to get the gui and selection process to
work together.

The next week is going to be a short one with the Fourth of July on Thursday.
Even though it is short it promises to be very productive since a brilliant
mentor is coming for next week. My plans are to quickly finish the recipe
selection and then assist with getting the badges finally implemented. Even
though there is still more that can be done to improve the game, which is what
I would prefer to work on the most. We need to get the badges working or the
whole goal for the summer will be ruined.
