IGM will again be running the course "Humanitarian Free and Open Source
Software Development" this Spring. It'll be taught this year by established
Hacker Justin Sherrill ([http://www.shiningsilence.com/dbsdlog/author/admin](h
ttp://www.shiningsilence.com/dbsdlog/author/admin)). This course provides the
novices an opportunity to get started in Open Source, and the pros the
flexibility to get deeper into the field. The course has an emphasis on, but
is not restricted to, the creation of Free/Open Source/Open Content
educational games and software, but has also supported projects looking at
networking, server infrastructures, and other full-stack applications. The
majority of projects that have come out of the course in the past have
supported the One Laptop Per Child ([http://laptop.org](http://laptop.org))
and Sugar Labs projects ([http://sugarlabs.org](http://sugarlabs.org)). OLPC
XO computers will be signed out to each student for use and development during
the quarter.

Last year's syllabus (subject to major change without notice) can be found
here:

st/)

The course's number is 4080-445 and it is offered Tuesday and Thursday nights,
6-8 pm. The prerequisites are two previous programming courses, but if you
have an interest in FOSS development, or any FOSS development experience,
contact us and the prerequisites can be waived by the instructor. If you are
having trouble registering, don't fret! Email Prof. Stephen Jacobs, and we'll
register you for the course manually: sj[at]mail[dot]rit[dot]edu.
