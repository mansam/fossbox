Summary: So today JT and I ran tests on all of the various formats we had decided to look at, except SVGs, and we learned a lot of useful information we did not previously know. First and foremost we learned that bmp, while a larger format when it comes to file size, is easily the best for performance. It constantly performed almost two times better than every other format in every test. We also learned that when we used images with transparency, whether it was built- in with the format or rendered to lo ... 

So today JT and I ran tests on all of the various formats we had decided to
look at, except SVGs, and we learned a lot of useful information we did not
previously know. First and foremost we learned that bmp, while a larger format
when it comes to file size, is easily the best for performance. It constantly
performed almost two times better than every other format in every test. We
also learned that when we used images with transparency, whether it was built-
in with the format or rendered to look transparent through the system, it made
the program run a few frames faster. While this was negligible within the
testing environment it could be very helpful within a game environment.

Overall we gathered a lot of very useful information about what advantages and
disadvantages each format has. It has been a good day so far.
