I went shopping for a business formal outfit for the White House yesterday, I
left at 2:00. I thought I would be back in time for debrief, in time to write
up a lovely wrap up blog. I got back at 8:00 pm. -___-

I mean seriously? Seriously?!??

Well I found something so now I will be dressed appropriately. It didn’t even
occur to me that I was missing debrief until I got back home and looked at the
clock. (So sorry Remy!!)

So anyway, I got some good stuff done yesterday.

Finally finished the 10 bulls for the Fedora badges. (Attached)

And I created an alpha version of the mobile zone logo for SJ’s bike. (Also
Attached)

And some Lemonade Stand stuff… I will update again tonight.
