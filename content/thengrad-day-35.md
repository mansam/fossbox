A guest from Sugar came to visit today. He had a lot of interesting things to
say and was very interested in our work with the open badges for the Sugar
Environment. When he was talking to me about learning python I showed him
[Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) which is how I
learned python. He said he might consider it when he is teaching kids python.

What I worked on was finishing a way to allow players to create their own
custom recipes. That is finished. However, after showing it to the rest of the
group they had some suggestions of things I should fix. It shouldn't take me
more than an hour or two. Then after that I'm going to start working on some
badges things.
