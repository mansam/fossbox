Summary: Howdy,  This week has been full of fun FOSS related activities.  For Sky-Time I created the small icon that will appear on the desktop. The Pythonistas meet up was very useful. Some suggestions really helped the coding end of our project.  I saw Walter Bender speak! That was awesome. And after we talked about what icons he would like to see re-designed. So I will be attempting to make those real soon. Today he is coming to class to speak again.  This weekend is the Space Apps Challenge! And also ... 

Howdy,

This week has been full of fun FOSS related activities.

For Sky-Time I created the small icon that will appear on the desktop. The
Pythonistas meet up was very useful. Some suggestions really helped the coding
end of our project.

I saw Walter Bender speak! That was awesome. And after we talked about what
icons he would like to see re-designed. So I will be attempting to make those
real soon. Today he is coming to class to speak again.

This weekend is the Space Apps Challenge! And also Bar Camp.

See yah there!

-Jenn
