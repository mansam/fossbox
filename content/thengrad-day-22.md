Summary: So DAWacker found out why the events weren't showing up after five days had passed. It wasn't working because I was using the variable's name when checking how many days had passed when I should have been using the property's name. He the decided to fix it himself and in the process of fixing that he decided to completely rewrite a helper function that I had written and was still in the middle of testing, which prevented me from continuing working on my ticket.

So DAWacker found out why the events weren't showing up after five days had
passed. It wasn't working because I was using the variable's name when
checking how many days had passed when I should have been using the property's
name. He the decided to fix it himself and in the process of fixing that he
decided to completely rewrite a helper function that I had written and was
still in the middle of testing, which prevented me from continuing working on
my ticket. So I spent the morning looking at the tickets that still needed to
be closed for [Lemonade Stand](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand).
I've moved on to working on making it so the player can choose different
recipes for the lemonade. When DAWacker had finished his version of my helper
function I looked over it a noticed that some of the logic didn't match up
with the function I originally had made so I added a few small changes. Then I
tested it out a little.

Tomorrow I going to finish fixing some of the balance issues I had noticed
yesterday. Then I was going to give the new helper function a thorough testing
to see if it is fully balanced. Then I was going to implement my idea to make
recipe changeable in game which should be finished by the end of the week.
