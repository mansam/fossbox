DAY 2 of the summer Co-Op. yesterday I finally installed Fedora on my Mac
using the tutorial found here: [Fedora install on Macbook Pro](http://anee.me
/installing-fedora-on-mac-book-pro/)

After getting all o' this settled down and having a mid morning pep talk from
my mentors, we got to work finishing up installing some odds and ends on
everyone's new fedora boxes to make life a little easier.

We then proceeded to install sugar, and our respective projects onto our
machines, we started play testing Lemonade Stand. I attached a screenshot for
your viewing pleasure. ;D (Took me a little while longer than my other
teammates to catch onto how to make a higher profit than a couple bucks at a
time.....don't tell them xD)

For now were making a pretty sweet list of updates and patches for Lemonade
Stand that we will organize, combine, remove, and improve upon. (also attached
below)

HAVING A BLAST SO FAR! I LOVE COMING TO WORK!
