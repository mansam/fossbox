That may have been a strange solution, but I thought it would be better to take race and gender out of the equation. Also having a lemon for a head is kind of funny! However, I am a bit worried I am designing this for too young an audience. Maybe lemonheads are cool in third grade, but once fourth grade rolls around the  ...</p>
