Today the largest part of the day was the Lemonade Stand's start into creating
tickets on git hub so we can begin to tackle some serious steps into our
Lemonade Stand work.

Within every repository on github there is an issue tab. We use this tab to
create the tickets that we need to work on to make sure we accomplish our
goals for thie summers project. Here's a link on how to use the github issue
tab to its fullest extent: [github issues tab](http://openmdao.org/dev_docs
/dev-guide/issues.html)

We're still working on breaking down our wish-list into tickets and assigning
those tickets to people and milestones.

One of our team members updated the three yer deprecated lemonade stand game
to the new activity standards that are now required. We will most likely push
this new activity bundle to the [Lemonade Stand
Site](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4321) . The new
changes to sugar activities can be found
[here](http://rbrooke.blogspot.com/2010/01/creating-xo-file.html). That site
is how to bundle your python activity into a .xo file which is what the OLPC
XO uses for all of its activities, it's much more detailed than the actual
tutorial that was found on the Sugar site. We might be able to edit the sugar
page to make it a little more usable for non-coders, keep in touch for the
next blog to see how the Lemonade Stand team is progressing.
