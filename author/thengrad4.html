                <p>It is now the end of the fourth week of this summer research program. This was a week full of interesting events. This was the first week with the full summer crew present all week. There was a power outage on Monday that made only some of us loose power, disrupting work for a few hours. Then on Wednesday, the boat went down causing trouble with the meeting logs and many of us from writing the blog posts on time.  As for what I did this week, I found that because there was a lot of overlap on th ...</p>

                <p>There were several times today were I forgot to look at the IRC because I was far to busy digging through the code to see how I could improve the event generation system. I really like how it turned out so far. The changes that I made today was that I finished up having the events be chosen at random but with weights factored in. Then I set up a way for some effects from events scale and some not based on if the change is positive for a flat amount or negative for a scaled amount.   ...</p>

                <p>Today was a good day. I tried joining in on the order of wings with everyone and determined that I do not like it and won't be joining any future orders. I also redesigned how the game Lemonade Stand selects the random events in an attempt to make it be able to change the frequencies of events based on difficulty. However this has no made the Impossible difficulty a little to hard so I need to re-balance the events. With my new design we also need a few more events to really spice up the game. S ...</p>

                <p>The Boat sank. With that and the power outage this week so far has been an interesting group of mechanical failures. I'm so glad that it isn't my machine this time.  Today was a productive day for me. I spent the day working through the random event code in Lemonade Stand. I've managed to add in a few more negative events by going into the constants file and adding some more dictionaries to the list. I then made the negative events decrements a percentage of the items instead of a flat amount. R ...</p>

I gave up trying to work on the ticket I was assigned because there was just to much overlap that I was very unproductive. So I've switched my focus for now to work more on the random events that happen to the player and balancing some of them to help try and slow down the rate the player earns money.
