Today started by finding the last of the e-mails for our technology contacts,
then started sending them all out. We have now sent out all of the e-mails,
including the questions that we hope to have answered. We heard back from
DirectMedia Layer, yet wait to hear back from the rest of the technologies.
I'm very glad that we have contacted these technologies and am excited about
hearing their feedback and answers.

In addition to this, the team did a very good brainstorming session on
narrowing down our combat systems and analyzing problems within games,
including how to avoid these problems in our own game. By analyzing the
problems in games, it allowed the team to get a sense of what we don't want to
do in our game. It allowed us to narrow down our combat systems farther and
allowed the team to get a sense for how we should proceed next. Tomorrow we
will be doing a similar brainstorming session on setting.
