Summary: # UGH!!!!! School-Servers ... 

# UGH!!!!! School-Servers

[Day 15:](http://foss.rit.edu/node/502)

-> McNair Scholars program began  
-> Installed 2/3 of a School-Server  
-> Raked in dough in lemonade-stand  
-> TIL Big, established college networks don't like new networks being created within them.

[Day 16:](http://foss.rit.edu/node/516)

-> Couldn't connect to the school-server I had installed  
-> Felt quite productively lost  
-> RocPy was a healthy and thriving programming-friendly experience  
-> TIL Programmers have monthly meetings to discuss their programming projects, but they separate by coding language

[Day 17:](http://foss.rit.edu/node/519)

-> Threebean introduced me to someone working on RIT's network  
-> Went through all XOs to gather their MAC addresses to put on a whitelist  
-> "The Boat", i.e. the server that housed Qalthos' school-server attempts, this website, and our chat-bot can and did go down  
-> TIL Command line binary files and scripts are saved in /bin/ and /sbin/, respectively

[Day 18:](http://foss.rit.edu/node/523)

-> Tried to run xs-setup-network even though I was 90% sure it wouldn't work  
-->> It didn't  
-->> It did do a good job disappointing me  
-> I ran this: "grep -inr xs-setup * | less"  
-> I acquired the locations of the scripts and source code command behind xs-setup commands  
-> TIL Not every command or install script has a man page

[Day 19:](http://foss.rit.edu/node/524)

-> Was worried about failure  
-> I set myself upon a tedious path that might result in too much information  
-> I lack the proof to show my responsibilities  
-> TIL about a free [meme generator site](http://meme5.net/#t=Generate_your_memes;b=with_HTML5;) written in HTML 5 that outdoes quickmeme!
