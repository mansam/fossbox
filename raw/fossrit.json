Morozov feels that\nO'Reilly manipulates the technology/business community, particularly in the\nperception of Free versus Open Source software, to benefit his own economic\ninterests at the expense of the overall good.\n\n**The Good**\n\n- Morozov backed up his argument with direct quotes from O'Reilly in different forms of media. The overall criticism is pretty harsh. By backing up with direct quotes over paraphrasing adds some credence to his argument.\n\n- The article was interesting. I didn't agree with all of Morozov's argument, but he did make a compelling argument that was interesting to read (much more interesting than the last article).\n\n- Definitely enlightened me to more of the Free versus Open Source debate that I have heard about but never really researched. This was super informative.\n\n**The Bad**\n\n- Lot's of his arguments felt very much like Ad hominem. I know that when this article was introduced it was described as not be personal attacks and Morozov goes out of his way to say this isn't a personal attack, but some of the language still felt that way.\n\n- After a while his arguments felt like he was beating a dead horse. The same thing was said repeatedly. He may have been able to shorten the whole thing and make it more poignant.\n\n- Although reading about the Free versus Open Source argument is certainly enlightening, I wonder if it is really beneficial to be teaching it. Propagating Holy Wars isn't good. Free and Open Source are both important in my opinion, but now almost everyone in this class has a tainted view of Open Source.\n\n**The Questions**\n\nWhy did Morozov feel that all of the time/effort he spent writing this article\nwas worth it? It was a lot of work for a criticism with no constructive\nsolutions offered.\n\nI know that there is [Richard Stallman's\nResponse](http://thebaffler.com/blog/2013/04/richard_stallman_responds) to\nthis article. What are some other good responses/articles on the subject?\n\nDoes the Free versus Open Source movement matter as much today. To me, FOSS is\none overarching title that is important in both aspects. I wonder if this\nmatters very much outside of the historical context.\n\n**My Review**\n\nOverall, I found the article interesting and I am glad that I read it. I don't\nparticularly like reading very biased articles when I am uninformed in a\nsubject, but I think this article is particularly important if you are really\nresearching the Free versus Open Source schism.

  "markdown_content": "So during Software Freedom day I began hacking on the [BeagleBone\nBlack](http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black) and a small stepper\nmotor. Are only goal was to gain familiarity with the BeagleBone by\ncontrolling the stepper motor with Python code that is FOSS.\n\nFor the hardware setup I utilized the [28BYJ-48 Stepper\nMotor](http://robocraft.ru/files/datasheet/28BYJ-48.pdf), the [L293D Driver\nChip](http://www.datasheets360.com/pdf/624709677179081801?comp=3509), a\nbreadboard, some wires, and of course the BeagleBone Black. I had both the\nchip and motor from a kit I bought from AdaFruit, so I used [her guide to\nwiring the board](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-16\n-stepper-motors/breadboard-layout) as my breadboard setup.\n\nWhen looking for code to run the stepper motor I came across [ this\nblogpost](http://petebachant.me/stepper-motor-control-with-the-beaglebone-\nblack-and-python/) discussing almost exactly what I was trying to do.\nUtilizing this code, [David](https://github.com/DaWacker) and I (but 99%\nDavid) configured the BeagleBone so we could ssh in, and put the bb_pystepper\ncode on the BeagleBone, as well as the adafruit stepper library which was a\ndependancy.\n\nUnfortunately, when we attempted to run the code I discovered that motor only\nvibrated, it didn't actual spin. We went to a lab and started testing outputs\nwith an o-scope and a mulitmeter to no avail. We even tried providing power\nfrom another source to see if the BeagleBoard was having difficulty driving\nenough current. Finally I started software debugging which is when I\ndiscovered a little variable in the code called steps_per_rev.\n\nThis variable describes the number of steps the motor takes in a spin.\nCurrently, it was set to 2048.0, which was far too high for my motor.\nEssentially, signals were being sent so quickly that the motor was able to\nregister the pulses. After a little bit of playing around we settled on 512\nbeing a solid value. However, I was displeased that my testing required me to\nactual change the hardcoded value. Instead, I moved the steps_per_rev as an\noptional constructor argument, as well as moving the pins that drive the\nmotor. This is a sample of how the code runs now with my updates.\n\n$ cd bb_pystepper\n\n$ python\n\n>>> from bb_pystepper import Stepper\n\n>>> mystepper1 = Stepper() # Creates default stepper motor\n\n>>> mystepper2 = Stepper(512.0) # Creates motor with 512 steps_per_rev\n\n>>> mystepper3 = Stepper(256.0, ['P8_17', 'P8_18', 'P8_19', 'P8_20']) # Motor\nwith 256 steps per rev and different pin mappings\n\n>>> mystepper1.rotate(180, 10) # Rotates stepper 1 180 degrees at 10 RPM\n\n>>> # (will also rotate stepper2 because they are mapped to the same pin\n\n>>> mystepper3.rotate(-180, 5) # Rotates stepper 3 back 180 degrees at 5 RPM\n\nI am much happier with this version of the code because it allows for multiple\nmotors to be run independantly with different steps_per_rotation. It also\nshould make the selection of the correct steps_per_rotation a lot easier. I\nstill feel that the code could use some improvements for ease of use and\ngeneral configuring but I will go to that soon.

  "markdown_content": "There once was a game called SkyTime. SkyTime was created by a group of brave\nand super attractive RIT students. This game, being of humanitarian purpose\nand just cause, was honored by the White House in Washington DC. (You know,\nthe one that is the center of American politics and all of that :D)\n\nIt is the night before the event, and our fantastic heroine (me) is preparing\nto leave for the airport. I make a call to check the flight status, but to\neveryone’s dismay: THE FLIGHT IS CANCELLED. (Cue dramatic music)\n\nI frantically bought an Amtrak ticket and rushed to Penn Station. I arrived in\nDC as the clock struck twelve am.\n\n---\n\nI am walking towards the White House in my new, moderately uncomfortable\nshoes. The hotel is just around the block, so it takes only a few minutes and\none conversation with a security guard to find the correct entrance. The\nsecurity line winds outside the gate. I get in line behind a woman who is most\nprobably a CIA agent; she just looks like someone that gets shit done. She\ncarries a metal brief-case, the kind that often self-destructs in movies. I\nnervously ask if this is the 17th street and NY Avenue entrance. It is. She\ncasually mentions she has an important meeting. No big deal. I try not to\nappear too in awe of someone who has important meetings in the White House.\n\nThe line moves slowly. I get up to the first round of security guards, give my\nlicense, get back on line. It is pretty easy to distinguish who is here for\nthe Champions of change event and who is just here for another day at work.\nSome guy is not on the list, the guards kick him out.\n\nI finally arrive at the last security check. I shuffle into a room with a dog\nand trainer behind a screen. I step onto painted footprints and fans blow my\nsent towards the dog. Apparently I am only smelly in the pleasant sort of way,\n(must be all that fancy hotel soap) so I am given a green visitors pass and\nshuffle inside to the South Court auditorium.\n\nThe room is not huge, a lot of people are milling about. I manage to find an\nempty seat. I am pretty sure I was sitting in the room where Obama gives press\nreleases. SUPER COOL! The event begins. You can watch it in all of its\nhumanitarian hacking glory here:\n\n[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/07/23/champions-\nch...](http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/07/23/champions-\nchange-open-government-and-civic-hacking)\n\nAs it finished everyone got up for lunch, I made a beeline for one of the\nChampions of Change, Jessica Klein.\n\n[http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/je...](http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/jessica-klein)\n\nI was on a mission. She is working for Mozilla on open badges. FOSS@RIT has\nbeen doing a ton of work with that this summer. It was important that I\nconnected with her! We exchanged contact info and talked. She seemed very\ninterested in the XO laptop and helping to get Open Badges working on them.\nHopefully she will visit RIT sometime next year.\n\nThere wasn’t really a good place to eat lunch, so I took the opportunity to\naimlessly explore the White House. I took the spiral staircase up and down,\nalways trying to convey an air of certainty, like I knew where I was going and\nthat I was supposed to be there. Some things I learned about the White House:\n\n-The pillars along the walls are mostly painted white, but the ones near the staircases are painted purple.  \n- There are very ornate knobs on every door. (Even to the bathrooms.)  \n-The library is a sacred place. It conveys such a strong aura of knowledge and beauty I was scared to approach.  \n-There are small TV’s in every room. (Also including the bathrooms)\n\nAfter lunch there were workshops we could choose to attend. I went to “How to\napply Tech and Civic Hacking in Your City.” It was a really interesting\nconversation. Hackathon organizers from around the country took the\nopportunity to tell the government officials running the workshop their\nopinion of the best methods of releasing data useful for civic hackers. I\nlearned of a civic hacking space in San Francisco called “Free Space,” and\nconnected with one of the other champions of change Rob Davis.\n\n[http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/ro...](http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/robert-davis)\n\nIt was nice talking to someone of similar age, and he was a really cool guy! I\nalso briefly introduced myself to Brad Lander.\n[http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/br...](http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/civic-hacking-and-open-\ngovernment/brad-lander)\n\nHe is a councilman near to my home town, so it was pretty fabulous exchanging\ncards with him.\n\nThe events in the White House were over.

I took the spiral staircase up and down, always trying to convey an air of certainty, like I knew where I was going and that I was supposed to be there. Some things I learned about the White House:\n-The pillars along the walls are mostly painted white, but the ones near the staircases are painted purple.\n- There are very ornate knobs on every door. (Even to the bathrooms.)\n-The library is a sacred place. It conveys such a strong aura of knowledge and beauty I was scared to approach.\n-There are small TV’s in every room.

When I asked my group mates who worked on translations they helped me get the translation file but it still causes a problem that they were unable to help me with. So instead of being finished after today it looks like it will take me at least one more day to set my ducks in a row. Then in is on to presentation land after that.</p>\n</div>",

We originally planned on working with SkyTime because we weren't happy\nwith how it performed on the XO laptop. We needed to update the drawing\nfunctions to allow the our North Carolina school to have an optimal beta game\nto test. Little did we know that our work would send our fledgling program to\nDC!! Currently, we have optimized SkyTime for the XO by removing the alpha\nfuncitonality, and replacing it with only pygame blit's. We also have\nlocalized the game to include English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The\nimages were replaced with updated graphical backgrounds, and a score tracker\nwas implemented to allow the students to keep track of how well they are\ndoing.\n\nLemonade Stand:\n\nWe ran into a bit of a road bump because our school server never got off the\nground do to unforeseen circumstances. SO we rethought our strategy and\ndecided it would be best to decentralize the badges process and place the\nbadges within a separate activity entirely, but have that activity update a\nwebpage whenever it connects to the internet. Currently, the game creates a\ndatastore object and saves specific data to the object, thus creating a place\nfor us to begin our badges work. The Lemonade stand game as it stands has had\nan almost total make over. New Screens have been added, as well as new\ngraphics for each screen, new themes for the stand, new localization themes\nfor different languages to be selling native products instead of just\nlemonade. Difficulty settings, game modes, and new random events have been\nadded to provide more depth to the game. We believe that this will encourage\nplayers to continue to play for the badges that will be implemented shortly.\n\nSash:\n\nThis is the activity that we decided on creating to display the badges, but\nwill also have the functionality to award the badges as well. Because of the\ncurrent excitement surround SkyTime, Sash has been placed on a back burner and\nstill stands as just an icon that shows up on the Sugar XO homepage. Now that\nSkyTime has been shipped out, we plan on bring some heat to the Sash to start\ncoding in some badge and display functionality this week to further our\nmilestones before we need to present our summer research findings.\n\nThat's the most current updates we have so far, nothing too much in searching\nand usability in this blog post, but we will without a doubt find more bumps\nalong the road to throw some sweet links and code bits here for all you devs\nout there.\n\n",

SkyTime is an educational game for the [Sugar Desktop\nEnvironment](http://sugarlabs.org) running on the XO laptop of the [One Laptop\nPer Child (OLPC)](http://laptop.org) initiative. The event celebrates the best\nprojects to emerge from the nationwide Hack for Change event that was part of\nthe National Day of Civic Hacking. In particular, the Champions of Change\nprogram will highlight _“…extraordinary leaders in transformative civic\nhacking and civic engagement”_ and we are thrilled that RIT students have been\nchosen to be included in this event. More information on the Champions of\nChange program is available at\n[http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions](http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions).\n\nThe student team members responsible for \"Sky Time\" are:\n\n  * Jennifer Kotler, Major in Biomedical Illustration, CIAS*\n  * Ryan Stush, New Media Interactive Development, GCCIS\n  * David Wilson, Game Design and Development, GCCIS\n  * Ian Furry, Game Design and Development, GCCIS\n\n_(*Jennifer is the team lead and will be representing the team in Washington,\nD.C.)_\n\n“Sky Time” began as a class project in a course on Humanitarian Free and Open\nSource Software offered through the RIT School of Interactive Games and Media,\ndesigned by Professor Stephen Jacobs and taught by Justin Sherrill. From\nthere, it was refined during the Rochester Hack for Change Hackathon, an event\nhosted by the RIT MAGIC Center and orchestrated by Remy DeCausemaker, Research\nAssociate at the RIT Lab for Technological Literacy's FOSS@RIT initiative. The\nhackathon was one of 95 events participating in the White House's National Day\nof Civic Hacking June 1st-2nd.\n\nCurrently, all four students are working through FOSS@RIT initiative this\nsummer. Ryan, David and Ian are working with a fourth student on another OLPC\nGame, a version of the venerable \"Lemonade Stand\", through the Summer\nUndergraduate Research Fellows program. Jennifer is hired by FOSS@RIT as a\nfull-time artist/designer working on several projects, including Lemonade\nStand.\n\nThis concept of taking class projects, ideas, and teamwork, and extending the\nwork, adding polish, and focus through the MAGIC Center towards greater public\nadoption and impact is exactly what we had hoped for when the MAGIC Center was\ncreated by President Destler in February.

  "html_content": "<div class=\"content\">\n<p>It is now the end of the sixth week of this summer research program. This was an interesting week since the Fourth of July was this Thursday. However, even if we didn’t work every day this week, the longer hours with the guest mentor made the week even more productive. I had a busy week working on different features in the game. I was planning on working on the badges this week but I didn’t discuss with the group as a whole to see were everyone was and what were the idea for badges we were all going to use was. So after putting a small in game menu to select a different recipe in game I switched to working on setting up the game to use more ingredients easier without always breaking. I was going to work on more features but I ran into a long chain of errors. I eventually found the cause was that all ingredients had to be listed in all recipes even if they weren’t being used in that recipe.

As it instructed, I went through\nthe code for Lemonade Stand and made each message script be convertible, like\nso: \"This is a string\" became _(\"This is a string\"), and at the top of the\ncode, with the imports I would have added the line \"from gettext import\ngettext as _\", but my teammate DAWacker beat me to it. I felt like I didn't\nhave enough information yet though, so I clicked [the link at the bottom of\nthe wiki.](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) The GNU project it linked to,\nthough factual and thorough, was mainly about C. I asked\n[FMD](https://github.com/decause) (FOSSmaster Decause, hereby abbreviated),\nabout a python equivalent, and he linked me to\n[this.](http://docs.python.org/2/library/gettext.html) As I read that, I tried\nthe section \"22.1.3.3. Changing languages on the fly\" out, because I didn't\ncurrently have a [translated file to work\nwith](http://liology.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/rosetta-stone.jpeg). However,\nit didn't work. I then [peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru)sed in\n\"/usr/share/locale/es\", where my computer stored it's spanish translations of\nprograms in .mo files. The day ended with my completion of a translating the\nmessage template gotten from running \"./setup.py genpot\" in the Lemonade-Stand\nrepository, a thing that [Qalthos](https://github.com/qalthos) showed me.\n\nLastly, I had a midterm powow with [FMD](https://github.com/decause) and\n[SURFcaptain SJ](http://igm.rit.edu/node/978) about how I felt the summer was\ngoing.

  "markdown_content": "This week I had a couple of big success. First, I solved my (most) of my\nproblems with avatar file generating. I also created a handful of templates\nthat I think should fit a variety of projects. Finally, I introduced an old\nproject that I had been working on with Python Turtle and will hopefully get\nsome help working on it.\n\nMy two main problems with the avatar generating were Unicode characters in\nusernames and difficulty handling all of the command line options we were\nhaving in log_generator and avatar_gen. To solve the problem with Unicode\ncharacters I used the function to_unicode() from a package called\n[Kitchen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kitchen) to encode every log entry I\nread in from a file to Unicode before I began parsing it. This prevented an\nASCII/Unicode mix that threw an error.\n\nTo solve my command-line arguments issue I utilized a module called\n[argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) to process my\narguments. The [argparse\ntutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html) from the Python docs\nwas really informative and thorough. Using the tutorial I was able to\nimplement argparse in both log_generator and avatar_gen in a way that is much\ncleaner than the logic we were using before. Another great feature of this\nchange is that all options for log_generator are now optional. I have defaults\nset so that custom logs can be generated without any arguments, which is nice\nin my opinion. Command line options are still required for avatar generator,\nwhich needs a list of names and email hosts, and a list of email hosts with an\nimage file path to run. Overall, I think it is a great improvement though.\n\nThe custom templates are pretty self explanatory. I have a feeling as we\ngenerate videos they will be edited a lot, but for now they are a strong\nstarting point. This week will be a little crazy with the 4th of July. Perhaps\nover that time I will try to actually render videos to work on these settings.\n\nFinally, I have created a repository for\n[AmazingTurtle](https://github.com/Zanarama/AmazingTurtle). Right now it is in\na very basic stage but the point of the project is to be an introductory\nlesson to programming for Middle school aged students through the Python\nTurtle. The lessons will consist of navigating the turtle through various\npuzzles, gathering stars and avoiding obstacles. I have actually taught using\nthis method to 6th and 8th grade students for two years now in my mother's\nclassroom. It has been highly rewarding and students have responded positively\nto the lessons. It is something that I have really enjoyed teaching and I\nthink will be a great educational tool.

I guess that'll just be the first thing on my gameplan for \"Hackin with <a href=\"https://github.com/lmacken\" target=\"_blank\">Lmacken</a>\" on monday. I can't install it on my tower because it thinks that it's drives are external, and I can't install it on my laptop because it can't dual-boot; it wipes a drive before installing.</p>\n<p>In other news I also had a public speaking seminar with the McNair scholars, and learned some valuable tips from someone who had some good chops on the subject. I'll be talking my presentations over with FOSSmaster decause though, who has public speaking chops, as well as sweet muttonchops. Due to the class I'm taking with McNair, I'm going to be Research lead on the project from now on as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://meme5.net/#t=You_know_what_really_grinds_my_gears~3F;b=Automatic_boot_protocol_that_doesn~27t_automatically_boot;i=meme-grindsmygears;\" target=\"_blank\">My feelings for the day</a></p>\n</div>",

[This\nwebsite](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar.datastore.datastore) helped me\nunderstand what a datastore is in a nutshell. A datastore, in my\nunderstanding, is simply a place where datastore objects are stored. Its a\ndatabase. The way the process works, is that an activity makes a datastore\nobject with some information. This object is then sent to the sugar datastore\nwhere it rests. The journal then grabs that object, takes the information it\nneeds and creates the entry.\n\nAfter some more powwowing with #sugar, I found out that the activity doesn't\nneed to implicitly create a datastore object because the journal can make\nentries with just metadata it shaves off of the activity that was run. This\ninformation saved me a ton of trouble.\n\nI tested this theory with the activity that I made in my Humanitarian Free and\nOpen Source Software and found that the journal did indeed make an entry. I\nthen tested Lemonade Stand, and found that it didn't make an entry. Over the\nnext three day's I committed myself to finding out why SkyTime worked and\nLemonade Stand didn't.\n\nFinally I came in contact with previous surf member who designed the Fortune\nEngine (the game engine that Lemonade Stand runs on) and shot him an email,\n[Jlew's Open Source blog](http://blog.jlewopensource.com/). He wrote back\nwithin the day and told me that there was an argument in the class params that\nset create_jobject = FALSE.

I was not paying attention to my\nlaptop when [FOSSmaster decause](https://github.com/decause) called a roll-\ncall to see who was in channel. being in IRC chat is one-third of the\nnecessary trifecta of Work-From-Home-Fridays, the other two being blogging and\nTickets.

If you have done as I have done and attempted to install a school server on an XO as they have described here: http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing, then code documents I was going to look through can be found in the following directories:\n/bin/xs-setup-functions\n/bin/xs-setup\n/bin/xs-setup-network\n/bin/xs-domain-config\n/bit/bootstrap-xo/\n/bootpart/security/state/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n/etc/rssh\n/etc/rc\n/etc/sysctl\n/etc/sysconfig/olps-scripts/domain_config,d\n/var/log\n/etc/rsyslog.conf\n/etc/sysctl.conf\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n/etc/rssh.conf\n/home/root/.bash_history\n/usr/share/xs-config/plugins.d\n/var/log/xs-setup.log\n/usr/share.xs-config/cfg\nI have been taking notes on my computer, but will very soon post what I have understood about them and the methods therein on an EtherPad for all to see. As this is a long list of notes, I was fighting a losing battle against my procrastinatory and failure-ready past self, and only finished going through an embarrassingly small amount of code. I was not paying attention to my laptop when FOSSmaster decause called a roll-call to see who was in channel. being in IRC chat is one-third of the necessary trifecta of Work-From-Home-Fridays, the other two being blogging and Tickets. I'm working on this ticket, but have no proof other than the blogs, but that will soon change when I whip out the aforementioned EtherPad.

  "markdown_content": "CODE SPELUNKING!!! Yesterday was a very dirty day digging through code. The\nentire day I was looking at two sugar activities.\n[SkyTime](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4670) and\n[Lemonade Stand](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4321).\n\nThe ticket assigned to me was to get Lemonade Stand to make an entry into the\njournal. I used SkyTime as a parallel test case to see if something was\nblocking the journal from accessing the activity or if I needed to add some\nfunctionality to the activities to allow the journal to access the activities.\n\nMy journey began by pinging #sugar again to get some insight into what wasn't\nworking in our activities. They pointed me towards [The Sugar Datastore wiki p\nage](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team/Almanac/sugar.datastore.dat\nastore) which explains how the journal accesses the activity information and\nmakes an entry. After talking with the sugar team, they informed me that the\ncode which was in the wiki page manually made a datastore object for the\njournal to access, but the journal doesn't need an actual file to make a\njournal entry. The journal should be able to automatically make an entry just\nby grabbing some metadata from the activity that has been running most\nrecently. Also, i learned that the journal doesn't make a new entry for each\ntime the activity is opened, it just updates a previous entry that has been\nmade in the journal. To make a completely new entry, you need to select \"Start\nNew\" under the palette after you hover over the activity. After learning this\nvaluable information, I decided to test each of the SkyTime and Lemonade Stand\nactivities on a sugar XO to see if the journal did, in fact, make automatic\nentries. When I made a new Skytime entry, the journal lived up to it's\nreputation and made an entry flawlessly. When I tried Lemonade Stand, it still\ndidn't work. After some digging, The FOSSbox suggested that I try a difference\nactivity that used the Fortune Game Engine as well. This activity was called\n[Fortune Hunter ](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4272).\nAfter testing this game and getting the same results as I did from lemonade\nstand, I have concluded that Fortune Engine has something to do with the\nerroneous journal entries.

  "html_content": "<div class=\"content\">\n<p>CODE SPELUNKING!!! Yesterday was a very dirty day digging through code.  The entire day I was looking at two sugar activities.  <a href=\"http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4670\">SkyTime</a> and <a href=\"http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4321\">Lemonade Stand</a>.  </p>\n<p>The ticket assigned to me was to get Lemonade Stand to make an entry into the journal. I used SkyTime as a parallel test case to see if something was blocking the journal from accessing the activity or if I needed to add some functionality to the activities to allow the journal to access the activities.</p>\n<p>My journey began by pinging #sugar again to get some insight into what wasn't working in our activities.  They pointed me towards <a href=\"http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team/Almanac/sugar.datastore.datastore\">The Sugar Datastore wiki page</a> which explains how the journal accesses the activity information and makes an entry.  After talking with the sugar team, they informed me that the code which was in the wiki page manually made a datastore object for the journal to access, but the journal doesn't need an actual file to make a journal entry.  The journal should be able to automatically make an entry just by grabbing some metadata from the activity that has been running most recently.  Also, i learned that the journal doesn't make a new entry for each time the activity is opened, it just updates a previous entry that has been made in the journal.  To make a completely new entry, you need to select \"Start New\" under the palette after you hover over the activity.  After learning this valuable information, I decided to test each of the SkyTime and Lemonade Stand activities on a sugar XO to see if the journal did, in fact, make automatic entries.  When I made a new Skytime entry, the journal lived up to it's reputation and made an entry flawlessly.  When  I tried Lemonade Stand, it still didn't work.  After some digging, The FOSSbox suggested that I try a difference activity that used the Fortune Game Engine as well.  This activity was called <a href=\"http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4272\">Fortune Hunter </a>.  After testing this game and getting the same results as I did from lemonade stand, I have concluded that Fortune Engine has something to do with the erroneous journal entries.  Today I will endeavor to dig through fortune engine and add/delete the code that will make journal entries.</p>\n</div>",

Once here navigate to the center of the screen and take the badges 101 quiz to obtain your first badge and set up your backpack.</p>\n<p>Finally, probably the most exciting day this week was when another student who is working under the Google Summer of Code sponsorship bought in an OUYA.  An OUYA is the Android Gaming console and can be found <a href=\"http://www.ouya.tv/\">Here</a>.  We play-tested a number of games that you can find under the game tabs on the afore mentioned website.  You can browse the games and check it out for yourself at the <a href=\"http://www.ouya.tv/games/\">OUYA Games</a>.  This was a welcome break where we were able to find some sweet ideas from play-testing.  That's mostly it for the week, other than a work from home friday that was mostly productively lost again, I'm commiting this week to fixing up the journal and activities so they play nice together.</p>\n</div>",

To view our issues and milestones <a href=\"https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-stand/issues?direction=desc&amp;sort=created&amp;state=open\" target=\"_blank\">click here!</a> A while back I mentioned when we went through and assigned topics into such categories as \"Core requirements\", \"Would be nices\", and \"Maybe next times\", a la <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" target=\"_blank\">Miyamoto</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.thelivingmoon.com/43ancients/04images/Pyramid/Mayan_El_Castilo.JPG\">Pyramid</a>.</p>\n<p>Well, as you can see at the issues and milestones link above, we have categorized what we deem as necessary and split up the whole project into three two-week trimesters. This is our baby, so we felt free to call them trimesters and make some pregnancy jokes. Here's one I know:</p>\n<p>A man wakes up in the middle of the night to hear his pregnant wife screaming. At first he is worried, because she sounds as though she's in pain, but he ends up more confused as he notices, she's screaming \"Can't\", \"it's\", and \"we'll.\" The husband consoles her, helps her into the car and drives her to the nearest hospital. While they drive she screams \"Shouldn't\" \"isn't\" and \"won't\". When they get to the Hospital a doctor was available and they're taken to a room immediately. The husband explains to the doctor what's been going on, and the doctor in a calm voice responds, \"Don't worry, this happens all the time.\" The husband relaxes a bit, but then his wife shouts a loud \"T'wouldn't've!\" and he worriedly asks, \"Doctor, what's happening to my wife?\"</p>\n<p>To which the doctor calmly replies, \"She's just having Contractions.\"</p>\n</div>",

We use this tab to\ncreate the tickets that we need to work on to make sure we accomplish our\ngoals for thie summers project. Here's a link on how to use the github issue\ntab to its fullest extent: [github issues tab](http://openmdao.org/dev_docs\n/dev-guide/issues.html)\n\nWe're still working on breaking down our wish-list into tickets and assigning\nthose tickets to people and milestones.\n\nOne of our team members updated the three yer deprecated lemonade stand game\nto the new activity standards that are now required. We will most likely push\nthis new activity bundle to the [Lemonade Stand\nSite](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4321) . The new\nchanges to sugar activities can be found\n[here](http://rbrooke.blogspot.com/2010/01/creating-xo-file.html).

I will be posting more about this in the week to come as I will continue to hack away at it until Friday when we plan on releasing the improved version!</p>\n<p>I am very happy with my first week and cannot be more excited for the upcoming weeks and what I will be doing to help change lives around the world working with <a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu/\">FOSS@RIT</a> as well as bright and intelligent individuals!</p>\n<p>Also, as I was travelling home for my sister's graduation, I caught a quick picture of a familiar sight ;)</p>\n<table id=\"attachments\">\n<thead><tr><th>Attachment</th><th>Size</th> </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td><a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu/files/Lemonade Stand.jpg\">Lemonade Stand.jpg</a></td><td>1.34 MB</td> </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

Our aim was to make collaborating alot easier as\nthe project continued. I was the only one who had a Macbook to reformat, and\nposted entirely on this point in an earlier blog (see blog list for url to the\ntutorial I used). After all that was said and done, I picked up a couple cool\nfeatures from the [Gnome Shell Extensions ](https://extensions.gnome.org/#)\nsite to beef up my work space. I added a few features here and there to make\nlife a little easier in understanding how to use fedora with Gnome. We were\nintroduced to [PiratePad](http://piratepad.net/front-page/), which is a\ncollaborative note pad for team organization in tasks. We also started\npreparing for the National Civic Day of Hacking\n[NCDH](http://hackforchange.org/) which is the first holiday for hackers, that\nwas nationally recognised by the White House. Last semester at RIT, a team of\nstudents, including myself, worked on an educational game called\n[Skytime](http://playskytime.com/) for deployment into the Sugar Labs, OLPC,\nXO laptops. We had previously got it working, but for some reason it had some\nshotty performance issues when we put it on the acutal XO laptop. During with\nhackathon, three students including myself, decided to rework and update the\ngame so we could send a proper version to a school in North Carolina who had\nsome teachers that were interested in using it. Before all of this wonderful\nhacking could take place, we had to pick up and move our entire operation from\nthe FOSSbox, to a misc lab (now named the FOSSlab) on the second floor of the\nbuilding we were stationed in. There was alot of gear to transport, so we\nrolled up our sleeves and got to work. Most of the gear was rather easy to\ntransport and set up because of our careful planning the previous day in\nboxing, but I will vividly remember how heavy an old school arcade stand is\nbecuase we had the distinct pleasure to volunteer to move that thing to our\nnew location (it was a Street FIghter Game). We all put our blood, sweat, and\ntears into moving that plywood box (literally blood, my mentor Remy cut his\nfinger on a sharp screw while supporting it under a low hanging ceiling). As\nwe moving into week 2, I believe we have some very cool lessons forthcoming\nwith Github and various other programs which will make this summer even more\namazing!\n\n",

I am running [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) for the first\ntime (and loving it!), I began working on my first open source project for Red\nHat, and I attended my first (civic) hackathon.\n\nFor this first week a lot of time was spent setting up my laptop and the many\naccounts that I needed, and registered to attend and to give a 45 minute talk\nabout my Gource project at [Flock to Fedora](http://flocktofedora.org/).\nHopefully I will be selected to speak, but no matter what I am really looking\nforward to (hopefully) attending. I haven't been using Fedora on my laptop for\nvery long but I am becoming a huge fan and I love the open source culture. I\nthink attending the conference will help me meet a lot of new people and start\nto become more a part of the Fedora community.\n\nAs a way to start contributing more to the open source community and learn\nmore about how projects get started, I attended my first hackathon this\nweekend at RIT for the first National Day of Civic Hacking. The hackathon went\nfrom 3pm Saturday to 3pm Sunday for a full 24 hours of hacking on projects for\nthe good of our community. I was able to work on an awesome project called\n[Food Desert Mapper](https://github.com/JHKennedy4/FoodDesertMapper), created\nby [John Kennedy](https://github.com/JHKennedy4), a very recent RIT graduate.\nFood Desert Mapper is an application for crowd sourcing data on the\navailability of certain food staples at stores that accept\n[SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap) benefits in order to determine \"food\ndeserts\" or areas where obtaining these staples with SNAP benefits is\ndifficult or impossible. You can see live project\n[here](http://www.foodmapper.us/), so be sure to check it out.\n\nJohn Kennedy had already started the project during his last year at RIT, but\nwas kind enough to catch us up and help us contribute to the project.

Ideas that came to mind were being able to create your own recipe and prices as well as having different locations the player could travel between to attract more costumers. </p>\n<p>Along with all the ideas, I began to think of badges that could be created as our primary goal this summer is to implement Open Badges into Lemonade Stand.  One badge being reach a certain amount of money in a certain time frame.  More badges will be discussed later once we collaborate all of our results from the day!</p>\n<p>I also made my first million in the game in less than a third of a year!</p>\n<table id=\"attachments\">\n<thead><tr><th>Attachment</th><th>Size</th> </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td><a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu/files/LemonadeStand.png\">LemonadeStand.png</a></td><td>85 KB</td> </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

I made a “Solar System Sombrero.” Basically I sewed a soft sculpture of the solar system (to scale) and turned it into a hat so the wearer’s head is the sun. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/302057_10201199326011520_502884432_n.jpg\" title=\"https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/302057_10201199326011520_502884432_n.jpg\">https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/302057_10201199326011520_502...</a></p>\n<p>It was pretty fun crafting while everyone else was coding.

Pretty fun!\n\nGrid Paint 1: “A simple paint activity for kids to draw pictures using a grid\nof triangles. Be expressive using just colored triangles: now everyone could\nbe an artist!

By limiting how you can make the picture,\nit creates a great platform for divergent thinking. This alone is a great\nreason that this could be a successful learning game for children, but\nadditionally I can also imagine this program helping children get a stronger\nunderstanding of pattern.\n\nTux Paint 6: “Tux Paint is a drawing app for tiny kids. Most 3-year-old kids\nand many 2-year-old kids are able to use it, yet 10-year-old kids (and kid-\nlike adults) enjoy it too. Tux Paint features Tux the penguin, like Clippy but\nnot so annoying. Tux Paint uses stereo sound according to where the mouse\npointer is. Tux Paint is translated into about 70 different languages,\nincluding big-alphabet and right-to-left ones.”\n\nHonestly what I find most impressive about this application is the fact that\nit is translated into so many languages, and the program can handle right to\nleft alphabets. That is a large flaw in the Adobe design programs, so I find\nit pretty amazing that an open source drawing program for kids can do that.\n\n:)\n\n",

Most 3-year-old kids and many 2-year-old kids are able to use it, yet 10-year-old kids (and kid-like adults) enjoy it too. Tux Paint features Tux the penguin, like Clippy but not so annoying. Tux Paint uses stereo sound according to where the mouse pointer is. Tux Paint is translated into about 70 different languages, including big-alphabet and right-to-left ones.”\nHonestly what I find most impressive about this application is the fact that it is translated into so many languages, and the program can handle right to left alphabets. That is a large flaw in the Adobe design programs, so I find it pretty amazing that an open source drawing program for kids can do that.\n:)",

  "markdown_content": "On Thursday, August 2, the FOSSBox set up an event called The Playtestathon to\nencourage people to try out prototypes and games that students had been\nworking on at RIT. By hosting a Playtestathon we hoped to gain constructive\nfeedback on our prototypes and game. We also hoped to make this event\nrecurring so that students throughout the year could bring their work and have\na great learning experience, all the while getting feedback from people who\nwould play their game, making their games even more fun.\n\nLooking back upon the playtest there are several things that went\nexceptionally well. For starters we picked a very good time and location for\nour event. We also coordinated the event with other students across campus to\nplaytest their summer projects. By advertising accordingly, we brought in\nseveral other teams, volunteers, and even children to the event. Several of\nthese group members playtested our game.\n\nBy attracting numerous volunteers we accumulated substantial feedback. We\ngathered ten playtests of our combat system and twenty-four of our skill\nselection playtests. Each contains various pools of information that we can\ntap, including some specific feedback on our playtest. The information we\ngained ranged anywhere from young children with little game experience, to\nGraduate students from the school of Interactive Games and Media.\n\nOur playtests proved to be successful. The playtesters were excited and eager\nto try the prototypes, and they definitely enjoyed the experience. This event\npaved the way for future playtests. With all of the playtests and playtesters\nthat came, we realized that this was something that would be useful to\ncontinue on a regular basis. This event really provided for teams striving to\nget input and feedback. Each year this is likely to be the same, with various\nprojects in the future also seeking criticism.\n\nAlthough the Playtestathon proceeded very smoothly, there was definitely room\nfor improvement. In the future, we should raise awareness of the event\nbeforehand as much as possible. We’ll probably be playtesting over the course\nof the year, and being students, will be able to converse with our peers about\nthe event in class. We also need to get the School of Interactive Games and\nMedia more involved. They should be our allies in the creation of a playtest\nevent in the future.\n\nTwo smaller issues that we should address in the future, is to have more time\nto test, and to have more stations available.

This was pretty cool since I got to learn more about open source stuff and was able to get feedback on our game.</p>\n<p>We also did a lot of other activities on the trip in our free time.  Spot, the leader of the Red Hat team, paid for our dinner and meals several times which was really amazing.  He also told us about the the pinball arcade housing over 130 pinball machines.  At the arcade I had a blast playing pinball, air hockey, and pool.  Finally, before heading back we went to the MIT museum which had a lot of technological devices, information, and knowledge.</p>\n</div>",

I am very pleased what we accomplished,\nthere was a lot that we discussed and brainstormed. One of the major\ncomponents brainstormed was how the world would be based on the databases,\nbugs, and various fedora community components. A database or section of code\ncould be various regions of land. For example, the python land would be a\nlarge section of the world and map. A bug would become a dungeon and would\nspawn enemies. In this way the world that people would interact in would be\nbased on the community and the projects that were in development at the time.\n\nThe other major component discussed included how the economy would work. Using\nour land system concept above, each region could have property that valued\nbased on that region. A region could grow or digress and property could go up\nor down. By cooperating effectively a community could advance their own areas\nof the world. In addition to this, we thought about how monsters and boosts\nwould provide materials. Certain regions would only contain certain materials,\nfostering cooperation and trade.

A database or section of code could be various regions of land.  For example, the python land would be a large section of the world and map.  A bug would become a dungeon and would spawn enemies.

  "markdown_content": "# Crafting a Useful Message in 140 Characters or Less\n\n  * Be Clear\n  * Be Direct\n  * Be Selective\n  * Be Informative\n  * Be Timely\n  * Be Consistent\n  * Be Tactful\n\n## Be Clear\n\n### Use complete phrasing as much as possible\n\nMost followers will forgive you for changing words like 'to' to '2' and 'your'\nto 'ur,' so long as the rest of message is effectively conveyed. Avoid this\npractice unless absolutely necessary--which in truth can be quite often. The\nmore it is obvious that without making these kinds of elisions and\ntransliterations you would have exceeded the character limit, the better.\nSometimes however, it is best to rephrase your message. Use a thesaurus to\nwhittle down larger words, use adverbs and adjectives sparingly.\n\n### Don't just say things like \"check this out,\" or \"this is awesome\"\n\nExplain why it is awesome. Qualify your statement with some kind of evidence,\nor choose a more informative headline. Only use expressions like these when\nawesomeness is obvious in some way (be it visually, or contextually)\n\n## Be Direct\n\n### Use Hashtags\n\nThe best way to target your message is to tag it appropriately. Hashtags allow\ntweets to be categorized, converting content into atomized searchable data\nstructures. Events, communities, or organizations commonly select a hashtag\nfor relating individual tweets to one another that are about the same topic,\nor addressing the same audience. This practice is critical to targeting your\nmessage, and improves the usefulness and searchability of the content.\n\n#### Bonus: Use In-line Hashtags\n\nOftentimes hashtags are listed at the end of a tweet. Keywords within your\nheadline or message can be tagged by simply prepending a '#' before the word,\nwithout having to restate each one as an afterthought. This can help save you\nprecious characters, and create more interesting (and searchable) headlines.\n\n### @Reply\n\nIf a particular story or message is pertinent to an individual or\norganization, engage with them directly by including their username with an\n'@' in front of it, directly within the tweet. It is likely the user joined\nthis network because they wanted to be engaged directly, and mentioning them\nwill guarantee you get their attention, and sometimes cause your tweets to\nshow up in the stream of that user's followers (who do not follow you\ndirectly.)\n\n### Retweet\n\nA great way to get your message across is to defer to someone who has already\nsaid it well. This also instills a certain level of reciprocity of messaging\nwithin some users, who will do unto others accordingly.\n\n## Be Selective\n\nYour message history functions like a social media repertoire. Some people\nthink of their tweets like a CV; the longer the list, the more clout it\npresumably carries. Some people choose to be much more selective about how\noften they tweet, and the content they are willing to share with their\nnetwork.\n\n## Be Informative\n\nUnless you yourself are the subject which your followers are interested in,\nyou will likely want to share something in addition to your own thoughts. This\nis the 'payload,' or the meat of the message you are trying to relate or\nconvey.\n\nEloquent quips or jokes, thoughtful observations, humorous commentary, and\nother forms of self-narrative can be effective ways to deliver a message, and\ncan serve as their own payload. Doing this consistently can be a creative\nstrain, and occasionally you should support your opinions with references to\nother sources. This will help illustrate your point, and provide legitimacy to\nyour claims.\n\n### Images\n\nVisual messaging can convey messages that would easily exceed 140 Character\nlimits. \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" may sound cliché, but as a\npayload it is a message that can be quickly grasped, and transcend language\nbarriers.\n\n### Links\n\nThink of your tweet as the Headline, and the link as the full content. _Follow\nthe link first_ and be sure you know the nature of the content you are\nsharing. Many articles are written satirically, some headlines are\nintentionally sensationalist, and some are just incorrect. Be sure that the\nmessage you are crafting is consistent with the content you are sharing. If\nyou are linking to content that is controversial, offensive or not-safe-for-\nwork, indicate this to your audience in some way (perhaps with a #NSFW tag).\nHere are some suggestions to pique a reader's interest, and help with both the\ncrafting and analysis of your messages:\n\n####  Find an interesting message within the link you can quote directly.\n\nFind the sentence or phrase that best characterizes the article, or the\n'unexpected' bit that was surprising.\n\n#### Use a URL shortening service to conserve precious characters.\n\nFor bonus points, use a URL shortening service with built-in analytics and\nmetrics. Services like [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly) will track not only how many\nclicks a link gets, and when, but also from what source, and from where in the\nworld (generally).\n\n## Be Timely\n\nSuccess in many aspects of life is all about being in the right place at the\nright time. In the realm of messaging, this is no different. Sometimes\n**when** you say it, is just as important as **what** you are saying.\n\n## Be Consistent\n\nCrafting one effective message is not enough. If you want to consistently draw\neyeballs to your messaging, you need to consistently maintain a web presence.\nThere are a number of services you can use to automate this process, but\nsimply resolving to post at a regular interval, regardless of how frequent, is\na good way to show your messages are useful.\n\n_But proceed with caution_. There is a delicate balance to strike between\nsignal and noise. Some followers will stick with you, regardless of how often\nyou are broadcasting. Others will grow tired of your messages repeatedly\nshowing up in their stream, and perhaps even unfollow you as a result. Even\nthose who will continue reading your messages will have a hard time\ndetermining what is important from what is not, just from sheer volume alone.\n\n## Be Tactful\n\nDon't demand or beg people to \"like\" or \"repost\" your content. If your message\nis worth sharing, and you position it visibly through proper channels, it will\ngain traction on its own.\n\n",

This is the 'payload,' or the meat of the message you are trying to relate or convey.\nEloquent quips or jokes, thoughtful observations, humorous commentary, and other forms of self-narrative can be effective ways to deliver a message, and can serve as their own payload. Doing this consistently can be a creative strain, and occasionally you should support your opinions with references to other sources. This will help illustrate your point, and provide legitimacy to your claims.\n\nImages\n         Visual messaging can convey messages that would easily exceed 140 Character limits. \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" may sound cliché, but as a payload it is a message that can be quickly grasped, and transcend language barriers.\nLinks\n     Think of your tweet as the Headline, and the link as the full content. Follow the link first and be sure you know the nature of the content you are sharing. Many articles are written satirically, some headlines are intentionally sensationalist, and some are just incorrect. Be sure that the message you are crafting is consistent with the content you are sharing. If you are linking to content that is controversial, offensive or not-safe-for-work, indicate this to your audience in some way (perhaps with a #NSFW tag).  Here are some suggestions to pique a reader's interest, and help with both the crafting and analysis of your messages:\n\n\n                 Find an interesting message within the link you can quote directly.\n\n             Find the sentence or phrase that best characterizes the article, or the 'unexpected' bit that was surprising.\nUse a URL shortening service to conserve precious characters.\n             For bonus points, use a URL shortening service with built-in analytics and metrics. Services like Bit.ly will track not only how many clicks a link gets, and when, but also from what source, and from where in the world (generally).\n         \n\nBe Timely\nSuccess in many aspects of life is all about being in the right place at the right time. In the realm of messaging, this is no different. Sometimes when you say it, is just as important as what you are saying.\nBe Consistent\nCrafting one effective message is not enough. If you want to consistently draw eyeballs to your messaging, you need to consistently maintain a web presence. There are a number of services you can use to automate this process, but simply resolving to post at a regular interval, regardless of how frequent, is a good way to show your messages are useful.\nBut proceed with caution. There is a delicate balance to strike between signal and noise. Some followers will stick with you, regardless of how often you are broadcasting. Others will grow tired of your messages repeatedly showing up in their stream, and perhaps even unfollow you as a result.  Even those who will continue reading your messages will have a hard time determining what is important from what is not, just from sheer volume alone.\nBe Tactful\nDon't demand or beg people to \"like\" or \"repost\" your content. If your message is worth sharing, and you position it visibly through proper channels, it will gain traction on its own.", 
  "html_content": "<div class=\"content\">\n<h1>Crafting a Useful Message in 140 Characters or Less</h1>\n<ul style=\"list-style:none;font-weight:bold;\">\n<li>Be Clear</li>\n<li>Be Direct</li>\n<li>Be Selective</li>\n<li>Be Informative</li>\n<li>Be Timely</li>\n<li>Be Consistent</li>\n<li>Be Tactful</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Be Clear</h2>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<h3>Use complete phrasing as much as possible</h3>\n<p>         Most followers will forgive you for changing words like 'to' to '2' and 'your' to 'ur,' so long as the rest of message is effectively conveyed. Avoid this practice unless absolutely necessary--which in truth can be quite often. The more it is obvious that without making these kinds of elisions and transliterations you would have exceeded the character limit, the better. Sometimes however, it is best to rephrase your message. Use a thesaurus to whittle down larger words, use adverbs and adjectives sparingly.</p>\n<h3>Don't just say things like \"check this out,\" or \"this is awesome\"</h3>\n<p>         Explain why it is awesome. Qualify your statement with some kind of evidence, or choose a more informative headline. Only use expressions like these when awesomeness is obvious in some way (be it visually, or contextually)\n     </p></ul>\n<h2>Be Direct</h2>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<h3>Use Hashtags</h3>\n<p>             The best way to target your message is to tag it appropriately.  Hashtags allow tweets to be categorized, converting content into atomized searchable data structures. Events, communities, or organizations commonly select a hashtag for relating individual tweets to one another that are about the same topic, or addressing the same audience. This practice is critical to targeting your message, and improves the usefulness and searchability of the content.</p>\n<ul>\n<h4>Bonus: Use In-line Hashtags</h4>\n<p>                 Oftentimes hashtags are listed at the end of a tweet. Keywords within your headline or message can be tagged by simply prepending a '#' before the word, without having to restate each one as an afterthought. This can help save you precious characters, and create more interesting (and searchable) headlines.\n             </p></ul>\n<h3>@Reply</h3>\n<p>             If a particular story or message is pertinent to an individual or organization, engage with them directly by including their username with an '@' in front of it, directly within the tweet. It is likely the user joined this network because they wanted to be engaged directly, and mentioning them will guarantee you get their attention, and sometimes cause your tweets to show up in the stream of that user's followers (who do not follow you directly.)</p>\n<h3>Retweet</h3>\n<p>             A great way to get your message across is to defer to someone who has already said it well. This also instills a certain level of reciprocity of messaging within some users, who will do unto others accordingly.\n     </p></ul>\n<h2>Be Selective</h2>\n<p>Your message history functions like a social media repertoire. Some people think of their tweets like a CV; the longer the list, the more clout it presumably carries. Some people choose to be much more selective about how often they tweet, and the content they are willing to share with their network.</p>\n<h2>Be Informative</h2>\n<p>Unless you yourself are the subject which your followers are interested in, you will likely want to share something in addition to your own thoughts.

  "markdown_content": "I have been using my laptop for a while now for development on Empathy. Since\nmy laptop is running Fedora 16, there is less libraries that need compiling in\norder to run the latest git empathy. But like any project dependencies are\nupdated on occasion. It just so happens that the GTK+ dependency for Emapthy\ngot updated fairly recently, so when I pulled the latest code, my GTK+ library\nneeded recompiling. Eh, didn't seem like a big deal, compiled fine 1 minor\nversion ago, so I figured it would be easy peasy to recompile the next\nversion. Well, I was wrong.\n\nLike many a library, I had to recompile some other libraries to get GTK+ to\ncompile. It just so happened that the glib dependency had to be recompiled\n(and, of course, the requirements are far ahead of the libraries in the Fedora\nrepos, so recompile from source is really the only option). In GLib is a\nlibrary called gobject. GObject provides a faux OO feel to C. Very\nfrustrating, IMO, since it adds an absurd amount of complexity to any project,\nbut oh well, just gotta deal. So recompile, recompile, recompile, GLib seems\nOK, installed to /usr/local, everything seems dandy. Go to reconfigure GTK+,\nstill seems OK, go to compile... and hmm, interesting error.\n\nFor some reason the compile is failing during a link for which a symbol in\nlibgobject is missing. Maybe the problem is the linker flags, so 'export\nLDFLAGS=-lgobject-2.0' since /usr/local/lib is already specified in the build\ncommand.

  "markdown_content": "# Whats Going On?\n\nThere have been more than a few attempts at making a Sugar compatible video\nchat application. As it stands right now there are at least 4 or 5 that work\nto varying degrees. Empathy is probably the most functional app that I am\naware of, however, Empathy is not Sugarized (as far as I know). So after\nsigning up for a bunch of different mailing lists and asking a bunch of\nquestions here is what I have learned.\n\n# Build a Completely New Program\n\nAfter talking to the development lost for sugar, it seems possible to build an\napp in entirely C code that can interface with sugar through DBUS. DBUS is a\nIPC messaging system that many Linux systems use. If an application implements\ncertain DBUS interfaces then it can be \"sugarized\". So how hard would it be to\nimplement a DBUS interface in C? Well according to the API docs, pretty hard: \n[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html](http://dbus.freedesktop.\norg/doc/api/html/index.html). Apparently you would be in for a world of pain.\nThats not terribly surprising given the nature of C coding and the type of\nfunctionality that DBUS exposes. Thats just one part of the project.\n\nNext there is Telepathy. Interfacing with telepathy doesn't look too bad. The\ndocs appear to be somewhat here and there, however, which could lead to some\npain. However, the telepathy-devel mailing list is responsive and hopefully\nwilling to help if any telepathy interfacing needs to be done. And last but\nnot least: gstreamer. Interfacing with a telepathy client would require some\ngstreamer code (I think). I am not completely sure how much back end stuff is\nhandled by telepathy at the moment. Certainly implementing an RTP/RTCP stream\nwith session control would be a major pain and time commitment. Especially\nsince at the moment it is certainly in the pipeline to implement both audio\nand video streaming (a natural expectation for a video chat service).\n\n# Maybe There Is An Easier Way...\n\nSince Empathy does by default run on the XO platform it should be possible to\nSugarize the Empathy client. First some pros to this idea: all the low level\nmess regarding RTP and video streaming would be handled by Empathy/telepathy,\naccount management would be handled by empathy, basically everything would be\nhandled by Empathy (how nice), and it would be (I think) relatively easy to\nintegrate a Sugarized Empathy client into the Empathy RPM package for the XOs.\nNow the cons: the Empathy code base is not easy to dive into. After briefly\nlooking at the code, it would seem that there is just so much stuff going on.\nNative GTK in C is not exactly the most concise of GUI code (but I am sure its\nvery fast). Thus learning the code base and actually adding the required DBUS\ninterfaces for Empathy to interact with Sugar would be in all likelihood\nrather difficult. But not impossible.\n\n# What To Do?\n\nWell, those are my options. Either way I am going to need to really understand\nDBUS in order to implement the required DBUS interface for Sugar. The question\nis do the pros in making an Empathy based client out weight making a new\nclient from scratch. Time wise, will learning the Empathy code base be\nfeasible? So... In the next week I am going to commit to one of the paths once\nI have some more insight from the respective mailing lists and people involved\nin Empathy/telepathy and Sugar.\n\n",

DBUS is a IPC messaging system that many Linux systems use. If an application implements certain DBUS interfaces then it can be \"sugarized\". So how hard would it be to implement a DBUS interface in C? Well according to the API docs, pretty hard: http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html. Apparently you would be in for a world of pain. Thats not terribly surprising given the nature of C coding and the type of functionality that DBUS exposes. Thats just one part of the project.\nNext there is Telepathy. Interfacing with telepathy doesn't look too bad. The docs appear to be somewhat here and there, however, which could lead to some pain. However, the telepathy-devel mailing list is responsive and hopefully willing to help if any telepathy interfacing needs to be done. And last but not least: gstreamer. Interfacing with a telepathy client would require some gstreamer code (I think). I am not completely sure how much back end stuff is handled by telepathy at the moment. Certainly implementing an RTP/RTCP stream with session control would be a major pain and time commitment. Especially since at the moment it is certainly in the pipeline to implement both audio and video streaming (a natural expectation for a video chat service).\nMaybe There Is An Easier Way...\nSince Empathy does by default run on the XO platform it should be possible to Sugarize the Empathy client. First some pros to this idea: all the low level mess regarding RTP and video streaming would be handled by Empathy/telepathy, account management would be handled by empathy, basically everything would be handled by Empathy (how nice), and it would be (I think) relatively easy to integrate a Sugarized Empathy client into the Empathy RPM package for the XOs. Now the cons: the Empathy code base is not easy to dive into. After briefly looking at the code, it would seem that there is just so much stuff going on. Native GTK in C is not exactly the most concise of GUI code (but I am sure its very fast). Thus learning the code base and actually adding the required DBUS interfaces for Empathy to interact with Sugar would be in all likelihood rather difficult. But not impossible.\nWhat To Do?\nWell, those are my options. Either way I am going to need to really understand DBUS in order to implement the required DBUS interface for Sugar. The question is do the pros in making an Empathy based client out weight making a new client from scratch. Time wise, will learning the Empathy code base be feasible? So... In the next week I am going to commit to one of the paths once I have some more insight from the respective mailing lists and people involved in Empathy/telepathy and Sugar.",

There is a lot of talk about the OVC application created\nby a couple of RIT students:\n[http://foss.rit.edu/projects/ovc](http://foss.rit.edu/projects/ovc). While\nthey work on the python implementation, I am going to detail my progress\ntowards building a native C application.\n\nTo start of with, here is how I set up my development environment for\nwriting/compiling XO code. I don't know if there are better ways or not, but\nthis worked for me. This is all based on the guide posted here: [http://wiki.l\naptop.org/go/Compiling_C/C%2B%2B_program_for_the_OLPC](http://wiki.laptop.org/\ngo/Compiling_C/C%2B%2B_program_for_the_OLPC). Here are the basic steps (I will\ndescribe each on more detail after):\n\n`\n\n1. Build 32 bit VM for building code with a native XO file system copy.\n\n2. Copy the XO file system from an XO onto the VM.\n\n3. chroot into the copied XO file system.\n\n4. Configure the XO chroot environment, install some dev software and\nconfigure a user account to your liking.\n\n`\n\n### 1. Getting a 32 bit kernel running\n\nThis step was necessary since I am running a 64 bit OS (Fedora 12) on my\nmachine. However, to chroot into a 32 bit device, the kernel's 32bitness must\nmatch. Thus I needed a dev environment that used a 32 bit kernel. The easiest\nway to do this was, by far, to make a 32 bit VM (Fedora 16).\n\n### 2. Copy the file system off the XO.\n\nTo copy the data of the the XO, I copied from the XO to my computer via rsync.\nI used the commands from the guide on wiki.laptop.org with a few changes:\n\nOn my desktop:\n\n`\n\n$ cd /mnt/dm-0/olpc-dev\n\n$ mkdir olpc-root\n\n$ mkdir -p olpc-root/proc\n\n$ mkdir olpc-root/dev\n\n$ su\n\n# mknod olpc/dev/null c 1 3\n\n# chmod 666 olpc/dev/null\n\n`\n\nOn the XO:\n\n`\n\n$ su\n\n# cd /\n\n# rsync -a bin sbin lib usr etc home var australia.student.rit.edu:/mnt/dm-0\n/olpc-dev/olpc-root\n\n# rsync -a proc/cpuinfo australia.student.rit.edu:/mnt/dm-0/olpc-dev/olpc-\nroot/proc\n\n`\n\nAt this point, I had all the important stuff for compiling against an OLPC\nlaptop on my 64 bit desktop. From there I copied the FS I had built verbatim\nto the 32 bit VM.\n\n### 3. chroot\n\nThis sets me up in a shell that is effectively running on an XO laptop only\nthe underlying hardware is a little more beefy. Not much though, my VM is not\nparticularly quick. However, there is enough disk space to compile lots of\nlibraries and the like. On the 32 bit VM:\n\n`\n\n$ su\n\n# chroot olpc-root\n\n#\n\n`\n\n### 4. Configuring a user account for myself\n\nNow that I have a chroot'able build environment for cross compiling (well,\nsort of cross compiling) I installed some software using yum; some was\nnecessary for development, some just for comfort and ease of use.\n\nNecessary software (may already be installed though):\n\n- gcc  \n- make  \n- glib-devel  \n- gtk2-devel\n\nComfort software:\n\n- zsh  \n- emacs\n\n### Notes\n\nUnfortunately the 32 bit VM along with a chroot environment is pretty slow.\nUnfortunately for my setup there really is nothing I can do about this other\nthan installing a native 32 bit system. But I don't want to go there.\n\nFor now at least, this has accomplished everything I have needed for\ndeveloping C code against gtk.

It allows you to use pretty much whatever CSS you like, and even allows things like iframes (I know... iframes are bad...)</p>\n<p>I will be working on the skin more in the future, but for now, it is simple and very system-esque <a href=\"http://decause.tumblr.com\">http://decause.tumblr.com</a></p>\n<p>The next couple days I will be diving back into chapter-writing land, and cranking on my chapter for the upcoming \"World of Cybercrime\" book series. I'm looking forward to checking off \"become a published author\" from the bucket list :) In the meantime though, I will continue hating my life, and cranking on my 30+ pages of licensing, copyright, and opensource in the context of cybercrime and intellectual property.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck folks,<br/>\n--RemyD.</p>\n</div>",

The atmosphere looked more like NASA mission control and CSPAN\nhad a 40 foot wide HD love child.\n\nHere's the wonky backstory:\n\nProfessor Sean Sutton, Chair of [RIT's Political Science\nDepartment](http://www.rit.edu/cla/politicalscience/), and one of this\nauthor's personal mentors, wanted to do a live blogging event on election\nnight with his students. Andrea Hickerson, Professor of the [Department of\n\nCommunication](http://www.rit.edu/cla/communication/) Special Reporting in\nPolitics Course, also wanted her students to be neck deep in the races leading\nup to and including election night. Political Science Professor and Lincoln\nScholar Joe Fornieri too, wanted his students to have an outlet for their\npolitical interest on the big night as well, so between these 3 professors and\nthe Center for Student Innovation, we put together one big election night\nevent to provide political science and journalism students the opportunity to\npositively participate in the common goal of observing, analyzing, and\ncommentating upon the Election and the processes of politics.\n\nOnce the event was established, we began reaching out to our local media\noutlets with the help of [RIT's University News\nServices](http://rit.edu/news), and in particular John Follaco. At the same\ntime, friend of [FOSS@RIT](http://foss.rit.edu) and Local Public Radio & News\nPersonality Rachel Ward of Rochester's [NPR](http://npr.org) Affiliate\n[WXXI](http://wxxi.org), was invited to give a guest lecture in Andrea's\nJournalism Course. Rachel and Zack Seward met with our Programmer/Journalists,\nand were invited to participate in our election day coverage. Some weeks\nlater, WXXI contacted our team about covering the election and what our\nstudents were planning on doing so they could cover the story. The week before\nthe big day, FOSS@RIT sent some Hackers and Storytellers to WXXI HQ, to meet\nwith Rachel, Zack, and IT pro Steve Dodd.\n\nAs Monroe County and most other County's Board of Elections in New York State\nhave switched from classic lever voting machines, to new Electronic Optical\nScan Machines, we all had to work together on making use of the new results\nfrom the [ Monroe County Board of Elections\n(MCBOE)](http://www.monroecounty.gov/elections-index.php). During our Primary\nResults Viewing earlier this fall, we got our first look at the .XML files\nbeing made public, and the [ Flash Results page used to provide up-to-the-\nminute unnofficial results](http://66.192.47.50/flashresults.html) from the\nMCBOE.\n\nMost media outlets task fleets of interns with following results pages just\nlike this one, to manually copy, paste, compute, and re-paste the results into\n.html pages to provide results via the web. This process is painful and often\nby the time you go through all of this manual copy-pasting and refreshing, the\nresults are already out of date. .XML files, however, work very similarly to\nsomething like an RSS feed, and provide an ongoing stream of data to the flash\nsite. So why not try to tap into that stream to back-end and automatically\nupdate the .html results, instead of doing everything by hand? This is exactly\nwhat WXXI was looking to implement, and exactly what FOSS@RIT's Ace Hacker,\n[Nate Case](http://whynotwingnut.blogspot.com/search/label/FOSSRIT) was able\nto execute. After about 30 mins of phonecalls to the MCBOE, and whois'ing\nvarious IP addresses, we managed to locate the (at the time, inactive) results\npage for Monroe County, and another active results page put out by the same\nsoftware/voting machine provider in London, Ontario, Canada. From the results\non that page, we were able to prototype an .XML->.html results page that would\nlikely work with Monroe County's results once they were live!\n\nAfter a follow-up meeting on Monday and a quick tire-kicking session, we\npointed Rachel at the page, and embedded it into WXXI's\n[InnovationTrail.org](http://innovationtrail.org/post/election-night-results).\n\nAll we could do then, was wait.\n\n9pm rolled around, and we anxiously waited for results to start popping up on\nthe big screen. 9:15 came and went, and I nervously tugged at Nate's shirt,\nasking if he was sure everything was good to go. Nate smiled slyly, and said\n\"If they post any results, they will show up on the page. Don't worry.\" By\n9:35, a wave of gasps went across the audience, and then a round of applause,\nas the screens auto-refreshed and results began upticking on the screen for\nthe first time.\n\nOfcourse, any time you are testing live code for the first time, you are going\nto have to make some last-minute tweaks and adjustments. Our first hiccup was\nwhen we looked at the Race for 28th congressional district and saw what seemed\nto be Louise Slaughter, getting Slaughtered. This was a quick and obvious\nindication that something was afoot, and lo and behold, we found that the\nfolks providing the .XML file were re-using some of the id's in the code, and\nthat we needed to do some manual summation in our script.\n\nOnce that was tackled, a few moments later, one of the more astute students,\nAlexandra Howland of [Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu) tapped me on\nthe shoulder and said, \"It looks like there have been 1.2 million votes for\nCuomo, but there aren't even 1 million people living in Rochester...\" She was\nright, and we realized that the numbers were incrementing each time, instead\nof just updating. So we \"fixed\" that incrementation bug too, only to find\nlater that our results, though precise, were not exactly accurate. In fact,\nour results were exactly double the numbers coming from the MCBOE. Nate then\ngave the script one last tweaking, and before all the districts had reported,\n[we had a proper reporting page, with up-to-the-minute\nresults](http://foss.rit.edu/election).\n\nToo often, when students do projects in courses it is under some pretense or\nusing code that is only for a class project and will never see the light of\nday.

Andrea Hickerson, Professor of the <a href=\"http://www.rit.edu/cla/communication/\">Department of<br/>\nCommunication</a> Special Reporting in Politics Course, also wanted her students to be neck deep in the races leading up to and including election night. Political Science Professor and Lincoln Scholar Joe Fornieri too, wanted his students to have an outlet for their political interest on the big night as well, so between these 3 professors and the Center for Student Innovation, we put together one big election night event to provide political science and journalism students the opportunity to positively participate in the common goal of observing, analyzing, and commentating upon the Election and the processes of politics.</p>\n<p>Once the event was established, we began reaching out to our local media outlets with the help of <a href=\"http://rit.edu/news\">RIT's University News Services</a>, and in particular John Follaco. At the same time, friend of <a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu\">FOSS@RIT</a> and Local Public Radio &amp; News Personality Rachel Ward of Rochester's <a href=\"http://npr.org\">NPR</a> Affiliate <a href=\"http://wxxi.org\">WXXI</a>, was invited to give a guest lecture in Andrea's Journalism Course. Rachel and Zack Seward met with our Programmer/Journalists, and were invited to participate in our election day coverage. Some weeks later, WXXI contacted our team about covering the election and what our students were planning on doing so they could cover the story. The week before the big day, FOSS@RIT sent some Hackers and Storytellers to WXXI HQ, to meet with Rachel, Zack, and IT pro Steve Dodd.</p>\n<p>As Monroe County and most other County's Board of Elections in New York State have switched from classic lever voting machines, to new Electronic Optical Scan Machines, we all had to work together on making use of the new results from the <a href=\"http://www.monroecounty.gov/elections-index.php\"> Monroe County Board of Elections (MCBOE)</a>. During our Primary Results Viewing earlier this fall, we got our first look at the .XML files being made public, and the <a href=\"http://66.192.47.50/flashresults.html\"> Flash Results page used to provide up-to-the-minute unnofficial results</a> from the MCBOE.</p>\n<p>Most media outlets task fleets of interns with following results pages just like this one, to manually copy, paste, compute, and re-paste the results into .html pages to provide results via the web. This process is painful and often by the time you go through all of this manual copy-pasting and refreshing, the results are already out of date. .XML files, however, work very similarly to something like an RSS feed, and provide an ongoing stream of data to the flash site. So why not try to tap into that stream to back-end and automatically update the .html results, instead of doing everything by hand? This is exactly what WXXI was looking to implement, and exactly what FOSS@RIT's Ace Hacker, <a href=\"http://whynotwingnut.blogspot.com/search/label/FOSSRIT\">Nate Case</a> was able to execute. After about 30 mins of phonecalls to the MCBOE, and whois'ing various IP addresses, we managed to locate the (at the time, inactive) results page for Monroe County, and another active results page put out by the same software/voting machine provider in London, Ontario, Canada. From the results on that page, we were able to prototype an .XML-&gt;.html results page that would likely work with Monroe County's results once they were live!</p>\n<p>After a follow-up meeting on Monday and a quick tire-kicking session, we pointed Rachel at the page, and embedded it into WXXI's <a href=\"http://innovationtrail.org/post/election-night-results\">InnovationTrail.org</a>. </p>\n<p>All we could do then, was wait.</p>\n<p>9pm rolled around, and we anxiously waited for results to start popping up on the big screen. 9:15 came and went, and I nervously tugged at Nate's shirt, asking if he was sure everything was good to go. Nate smiled slyly, and said \"If they post any results, they will show up on the page. Don't worry.\" By 9:35, a wave of gasps went across the audience, and then a round of applause, as the screens auto-refreshed and results began upticking on the screen for the first time.</p>\n<p>Ofcourse, any time you are testing live code for the first time, you are going to have to make some last-minute tweaks and adjustments. Our first hiccup was when we looked at the Race for 28th congressional district and saw what seemed to be Louise Slaughter, getting Slaughtered. This was a quick and obvious indication that something was afoot, and lo and behold, we found that the folks providing the .XML file were re-using some of the id's in the code, and that we needed to do some manual summation in our script.</p>\n<p>Once that was tackled, a few moments later, one of the more astute students, Alexandra Howland of <a href=\"http://csh.rit.edu\">Computer Science House</a> tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"It looks like there have been 1.2 million votes for Cuomo, but there aren't even 1 million people living in Rochester...\" She was right, and we realized that the numbers were incrementing each time, instead of just updating. So we \"fixed\" that incrementation bug too, only to find later that our results, though precise, were not exactly accurate. In fact, our results were exactly double the numbers coming from the MCBOE. Nate then gave the script one last tweaking, and before all the districts had reported, <a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu/election\">we had a proper reporting page, with up-to-the-minute results</a>.</p>\n<p>Too often, when students do projects in courses it is under some pretense or using code that is only for a class project and will never see the light of day. This collaboration, however, was quite the opposite. Nate's scraper was not only used in an actual journalistic capacity by real journalists and news organizations, but he will also be submitting it as his final project for Andrea's course.</p>\n<p>WXXI and FOSS@RIT are already talking about next year's Monroe County Legislature Race, and helping the MCBOE test their software for next fall. Putting theory into practice, and applying the principles of computer and political science to real world situations, to solve real world problems is the exciting new direction that academic collaboration is taking here at RIT, and will continue to move toward so long as we continue to work with talented students like Nate, Justin Lewis, and Chris DesLandes, who deserve a special thanks for running the screens, writing the scripts, and keeping the wheels on the wagon during the event. </p>\n<p>Special thanks to WXXI and Rachel and Zack for giving our students a look behind the curtain at how political reporting actually works. Thank you too, to Professors Fornieri, Sutton, and Hickerson for giving our students the opportunity to actually apply their lessons, and the Center for Student Innovation for hosting the event.</p>\n</div>",

The thing that struck me, was hearing the words each person--hacker or not--chose as their 3.</p>\n<p>Of all the choices, the top 2 answers I heard were \"Collaboration\", and surprisingly \"Opensource.\" This, to me, was rather unexpected, as I in my limited research, please link me if I missed anyone, had yet to hear of many other departments or administrations other than the NYSSCIO team leveraging real Opensource apps or CMS's* (*disclaimer for all the folks out there rocking apache or other \"under the hood\" open tools for the purposes of sysadminery.) There were some folks who chose words like \"fun\", one triathlete type with \"Peddle-paddle-swim\", a few \"creatives\", but also a large amount of \"Accountability\", \"Security\", and \"Reliability\" as well. (This author chose \"from python import *\" on the first day (even though it was in fact 4 words) and developer-driven, code-centric, hacktivism on the second). The mention of Opensource or collaboration, in conjunction with any of the other terms though, was most notable, as introductions last year were not indicative of this year's trend of new-found adoption.</p>\n<p>Each project, once identified either through the <a href=\"http://barcamp.org/CapitolCampTracks\">CapitolCampTrack wiki</a>, or in the tradition of unconfrencing, walked up to the front of the room to pitch talks and choose blocks. Immediately, regardless of stripes or station, each of the representatives who were hacker types huddled together and queried eachother on what languages they had in their Stacks. <a href=\"http://seeclickfix.com\">SeeClickFix</a> and <a href=\"http://pages.e-democracy.org/DemocracyMap\">Democracy Maps</a> claimed <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a>. Myself and my associate James Turk (author of the Sunlight Python API) knew what we were going to be repping. So it was settled behind the microphone stand that the contingents would each get paired into their own room. (In hindsight, it may have been a good idea to all stick together for participation sake, but I'm the type of guy who isn't afraid to spoil the soup with too many cooks.) It was settled thereafter that there would be a session by the Senate CIO team on the OpenLegislation API, and<br/>\nthe new version they will be rolling out soon, along with some general background on some of the Mobile App and Drupal development that happens in their shop. After would be a 3 block hacksession, with a break-out for GIS and GeoStack related stuff with the DemocracyMaps and SeeClickFix teams, and then some more open discussions about social media, and more Drupal from the Senate CIO Team.</p>\n<p>After the schedule was settled and the camp broke for its first sessions, it was established that there were going to be some \"particularities\" about the network. For instance, our version of the civx beta was being hosted on port 9999 from our development machine, which was later determined to be blocked, along with pretty much every port but port 80 (and ofcourse port 6777, which was the port that IRC was running on, and subsequently became the port that we served the beta to... gotta love paster) After spending much of the day tweaking the beta and populating the navigation of the site, we finally had a chance to crack open the OpenStates (formerly known as FiftyStates) API, and see what sorts of NY related info we could dive into. After a brief discussion with Turk and his compatriots, it was decided that since the OpenLeg 1.0 API was not going to be supported indefinitely, and the senate was rolling out their 2.0 in the very near future, OpenStates would wait to start scraping NY. In the meantime, there was already some state related data, and we toyed with some API calls querying out some simple JSON dumps in CIVX-land for future use in widgets when the time comes.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, we had migrated, and were ready to present our NYSenate.gov Dashboard. We considered it a \"soft drop,\" meaning we didn't want to show off too much of it and steal our own thunder for the next day's capitol camp track, but we still got to show off some pretty shiny code to a crowd of fellow opengov kin.</p>\n<p>The after bar party at the Victory Cafe was wonderful. We had quite a gathering of folk from each camp, representing a variety of flavors and layers in the stack. First of all, it was worth mentioning that they were out of Guiness, and that after ordering a Smithix in its stead, sadly, that tap too, was on its last legs.  Both of these scenarios were easily remedied by our server, whom was doing a wonderful job tending to the sizable band of us, and the rest of the patrons too for that matter. After a spot of rain, we all migrated to the dining room proper of the establishment, and put in orders just in time for the last (or what we thought was the last--shout out Nate) of the CIVX team and Storytellers. </p>\n<p>Not a whole mess of photos could adequately document the whole mess of food that was ordered from around the table. These were the bacon cheddar fries, not pictured are the delectable sweet potato fries with the marshmallow dipping sauce... om nom nom </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4926780052_2e59949d29_m.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After some proper parlaying at the table upon a cornucopia of code bases, licensing paths, and all brands of politicking, it occurred to me that a large portion of the folks sitting around the horn, were also repping some form <a href=\"http://rit.edu\">tiger stripes</a> or <a href=\"http://rit.edu/alumni\">another</a>.  </p>\n<p>After some rather decent pub and grub, most of the teams scattered to the winds, a few surlier louts hung around for a few extra moments, (and maybe a few extra after that), continuing on rampantly across the spectrum of distrology, BDFLs, doing it right, and failure to fail early.</p>\n<p>The next day bright and early we started all over again. Stay tuned for Part II. </p>\n<table id=\"attachments\">\n<thead><tr><th>Attachment</th><th>Size</th> </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\"><td><a href=\"http://foss.rit.edu/files/emplazacrop.png\">emplazacrop.png</a></td><td>221.63 KB</td> </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

Basically as we got to the end of the day we found that some of the methods we were using, or planning on using, were not going to be as successful as we thought. You see, we intended to use a \"dirty\" update method. This means that instead of updating the whole screen every frame, it only updates the areas covered by objects that actually need to be updated. To do this, we would simply create a list of the rectangle objects associated with what needs to be updated. The problem, however, comes up when you have overlapping rectangles. This means that if you send in two rectangles that have overlapping areas, it will update that area twice. Normally this is not too big of a deal however it can become a big deal when you have situations where one object is fully enclosed inside another and both are being updated, or when there is a large amount of overlap between two objects. Today we are going to attempt to create a viable solution for this problem. Hopefully we will be able to. Talk to you next time.</p>\n</div>",

Obviously I did do stuff wrong at first but it has now all been fixed and the class is fully functional.  The only task now is for JT and I to get rotation working. Hopefully this will not be that bad but who knows. Worst case scenario we don't get it working and we have a good story for our White Paper but I don't think it will come to that.

So\nbasically I have been working on getting all of the basic functionality of our\nanimated objects in place so testing can be run to make sure they work. I\nfinished that up, started testing, and found a huge problem with the way I\nhave been rotating images. So basically when an image is rotated by a number\nof degrees that is not divisible by 90, such as 10 or 15 or 45, you are\ncreating an image that is not a square or a rectangle. To account for this,\nthe image editing program you are using or, in this case, the code itself,\nwill pad the image with white-space to make them completely square or\nrectangle.\n([This](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4787023853_81604d66b5_t.jpg)\nrepresents an image before it is rotated at all.\n[This](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4787023883_093dedb928_m.jpg) image\nrepresents an image after a 45 degree rotation with the Green part being the\noriginal and the Black part being the part that was added to make the image\nsquare.) Now this situation is annoying at first but becomes incredibly\nproblematic if you are in a situation where an image is being rotated a small\namount over and over like you might have in a game.\n([This](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4787654864_052367ce26_m.jpg) image\nrepresents this situation. We started with a the green image and then rotated\nit 9 times by 10 degrees each time. Each different color area represents a new\nrotation and the space that was added to the image each time. The lighter the\ncolor is, the earlier the rotation was. You can see that an image can quickly\nbecome humongous from just a few rotations.)\n\nThe solution to this problem is actually pretty simple. This problem, as I\nsaid earlier, really only comes up if you take the same image and repeatedly\nrotate it over and over and over. So instead we will have two image arrays\nassociated with each animated object. the first image array is the original\narray that keeps the original images at their original sizes and rotations for\nreference. Then we have the display array which has copies of the images at\nthe sizes and rotations they are currently needed. Every time the images are\nscaled or rotated or both, the system remakes the display array by re-rotating\nthe images and rescaling them. This is the best solution we could come up with\nand is probably the one we will stick with if we do not find any major\nslowdown comes about from using it.\n\nTalk to you guys next time and have a great day.\n\n",

Real deep. </p>\n<p>Like, all the way down to the bottem of the stack. Opening up SQLAlchemy source, DBSessions, engines, metadata... super low-level Database/Datamodel hacking. Halfway through, Lewk and I looked at eachother and thought:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n Did we dive too deep?<br/>\n Can we really build DynamicDataObjects on-the-fly?<br/>\n Are the Polymorphic Tables really supposed to be (ab)used in this way?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The answer all around was yes.</p>\n<p>After going to sleep Friday night after being well into the dawn, frustrated by blockers of various flavors and types from moksha all the way through our low-level models to our high-level widgets, we were not sure whether our beloved FactEntity Model could really do what we thought it could. Lewk said to me, </p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\"I just need to accept this, and sleep on these problems.\"\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was awoken by the familiar rattle-tee-clickity-rattle-tee-clackity of the old-skewl IBM keys. He said to me \"I was dreaming all night about this code. When I woke up, I had 2 ideas on how to solve the problem\"</p>\n<p>After a few hours of hacking on Saturday, lewk's ideas proved prescient. Our doctests were finally behaving. We felt the stack falling in line, and performing the way it was meant to. </p>\n<p>We dove deeper.</p>\n<p>By nightfall, we were dispatching polyscrapers, from a web-facing widget, to the first hit for .csv files on data.gov. </p>\n<p>Then the first 25.<br/>\nThen the first 100.<br/>\nIn about 6 minutes.</p>\n<p>By primetime hackery hours past midnight, we saw what 100 .csv files look like in a Jit-Hyper-Adjacency-tree, and by the wee-hours, luke refactored our grid search API to handle the newest jQgrid. By sun-up, we saw our first on-the-fly generated PolyGrid, and by well into the morning, before we went to bed, the column names were even auto-named correctly.</p>\n<p>I've never seen all of the pieces of the civx stack being run at once from one widget. We've basically, as far as a developer is concerned, captured the lightning of dataset lifecycle in a bottle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User Provides a url to our polyform widget</li>\n<li>URL is passed to the MokshaHub via AMQP message</li>\n<li>\"Interesting\" data is located, downloaded, and git committed</li>\n<li>Entities get their facts populated (Magic is invoked)</li>\n<li>DynamicModels are built on-the-fly and added to our postgres db</li>\n<li>Scraped datasets get a hypertree widget, and dataset profile widget</li>\n<li>Newest jQgrid is auto-populated with polyscraped data in real-time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a good 38 hours or so of the last 48 spent neck-deep in the guts of moksha and civx, PolyScrapers have hit our public dev repo. Currently we only handle csv's, but we're going to make our way though the civx.utils and add handlers for each of the \"interesting\" datatypes that we already scrape, and someday, all the kinds of datatypes that python-magic knows about.

I'm also workign on a supplemental,\ninformational guide to maintenance.

[This is the graph\nhere.](http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/3299/scalingchart.png) The test we\ndid was pretty simple. Basically we had 4 image sets in each format at various\nsizes and then we re-sized them all to the original image size. Then we looked\nat the frame rate to see how it was affected by the scaling calculations. On\nthe chart the percent next to each format represents the size of the image\nbefore it was scaled down. So the 200% images were 2 times the size of the\noriginal image. The blue bar represents the average frame rate of the images\nand the orange bar represents the average file size of the images.

Then we made\nversions of every remaining image format at 4 different resolutions, 1 set at\nthe original resolution, 1 set at a resolution that was 2 times as large, 1\nset at a resolution that was 4 times as large, and finally 1 set at a\nresolution that was 1.73 times as large so that if the functions we were using\nto scale the images had built in optimization techniques, that image would\nstill give it a \"run for its money\", so to speak. After we had all of the new\nimages we created a new version of the testing program that allowed us to\nscale all of the images to any size we wanted. We then ran the test and scaled\nevery image to the original image size.\n\nThe goal with this test was to determine if scaling images through the code is\na viable option. Ideally, if it turned out that scaling the images through the\ncode did not cause a major slowdown, software creators would have the ability\nto create one image set at the highest resolution they needed, and then just\nscale the images down to accommodate lower resolutions. This would be helpful\nbecause it would drastically decrease hard-drive capacity needed for the game.\nThe only negative that would come about from this situation would be that the\nimages would lose detail when being scaled down.

Then once the test program was up and running we\nwould then use the terminal program, 'htop' to record the CPU cycles and\nmemory use. The goal here was to determine how much memory was being used with\neach different file format. In theory some file formats would have used more\nmemory then others and we would have been able to tell which is ideal simply\nfrom this test. In reality when we used 'htop' we found that every test, no\nmatter what the file sizes were for the different images, said we were using\n100% of the CPU cycles. On top of that, we also found that larger files would\nshow up as using less memory. Obviously this method of recording data was not\ngoing to suffice.\n\nTo solve our problem we are now retooling the program so that it prints out\nthe frames per second on screen. Our goal here is to create a system of data\nrecording that will be accurate enough to give us some idea of what's going\non.

Basically JT and I have run into a problem with our testing. Our original plan for testing was to have an image on the screen that was moving across the screen in a specific pattern and was constantly cycling between a set of images. Then once the test program was up and running we would then use the terminal program, 'htop' to record the CPU cycles and memory use. The goal here was to determine how much memory was being used with each different file format.
