# Work from Real-Home Friday!!!!!

Though Fridays are work from home fridays, I went back to my home of origin in
nyc for the weekend and worked from there.

I spent most of today figuring out how [áccént márks and special ñ
characters](http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/100808/how-to-type-spanish-
letters-and-accents-#.UduHj_mkqtY) could be typed into the the [spanish versio
n](http://www.pixfans.com/imagenes/2009/01/street_fighter_ii_spanish_version.g
if) of [lemonade stand.](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand) On
wednesday [Qalthos](https://github.com/qalthos) instructed me on the
difference between [ascii and unicode
characters](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html) It was a bit
infuriating, because if something didn't work, it would break the entire game
when that screen was reached, like if I tried to make changes to the day log's
output, telling the messages to "` .decode('utf8')`" within a "` .format()`"
block, or within the "` .blit_to_block()`" function. (FYI the "lemonade stand"
link this time is to our github repo, not the wiki) In the end, I managed to
fix it whenever it was in a larger font, such as the menu screen, difficulty
screen, or shop heading. However, the log proved to be the most resilient,
making me wait until I can ask a mentor on tuesday.

Today I also watched the [Gentlemen's Semifinals at
Wimbledon](http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/schedule/schedule19.html)
with [my father](http://empoweredtoconnect.org/wp-
content/uploads/darth_vader_worlds_best_dad_poster.jpg), and though I haven't
watched tennis in quite a while, it still very entertaining. I highly
recommend watching tennis if you like tennis.
