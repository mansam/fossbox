I've been working away at being able to make a custom recipe creation screen.
It was a lot of work but I'm almost finished with the interface for it. There
are just a few more tweaks needed to clean up the interface, like somethings
aren't showing up and I'm not sure why. Then all I need to do is finish
hooking together all of the back end stuff that I built yesterday as well as
create a few checks so the player can't break the game and having the player
be able to create their own custom recipes will be finished. Then it is on to
fixing the events so that different stands will not break because the even
references a non existent item.
