Today we accomplished a lot of revision and compilation work. After a meeting
with SJ we learned that our story was a little to similar to the Tron story,
so we molded it while keeping the overall mechanics and game play style in
place. What we came up with is an abandoned earth in which sentience is given
to robots, allowing them to expand out from the human cities. Above and beyond
this, we started compiling a lot of our work into the treatment document. We
now have a rough overview for most of the sections of the final treatment
document.
