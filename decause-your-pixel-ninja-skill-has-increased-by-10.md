These 1200x800ish some-odd pixels may not look like much, but each one was
carefully shift+arrowed into it's rightful place, and ctrl+click scaled to
just the right size.

One of the hardest things to give up when I switched to Linux/BSD/FOSS 10
years ago (gasp), was MS Paint. It was the only piece of software I was ever
truly proficient with on our family Windows 3.1 box (Solitaire doesn't count
obv). Tux Paint never quite filled the gap for me, The GIMP was much too
hardcore, and my pixel skillz languished for some time. Steadily over the past
2 years, with lots of watching and learning with my girl, my pixels have
become web native, lossless, and Free. I haven't quite gotten all the bells
and whistles down, and I'm still not using layers properly, but damn it feels
good to be slanging hex. Big shout out to my Digital Design instructor Prof.
Cameron, who let me use inkscape on my Linux box during what amounted to an
Adobe Creative Suite 101 course held in a Mac Lab.
