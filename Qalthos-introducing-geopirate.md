So I've recieved my apparently mandated CIVX nickname, despite it possibly
being inaccurate in a week or two. I, along with Pixel Ninja and Python
Princess, have been hacking away at our various tasks together for over a week
now, and despite the seemingly constant moving from place to place, it's a
pretty sweet gig.

My work yesterday was some final polishing of the getall script, and my first
real push to the geowebdns repository. I'm also workign on a supplemental,
informational guide to maintenance. Unfortunately, my changes can't quite
replace the old script yet, because the import script (the one that actually
starts to bring the files into the database and do something with them) is
hardcoded to the current files and that script is a bit harder to hack than
the download script. The real work was on the documentation, trying to get
people to understand my reasoning behind the changes and allow for them to
continue my work without too much difficulty.
