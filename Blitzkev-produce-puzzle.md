The first thing I did today was to fix two bugs in the new MAFH, [https://fedo
rahosted.org/fortune_hunter/ticket/39](https://fedorahosted.org/fortune_hunter
/ticket/39) and one related to targeting enemies that no longer exist. I spent
a few hours helping the games for science team, getting them up-to-date on git
and how the game engine works.

I talked to Abbi Honeycutt, a developer of the Math4 game produce puzzle [http
://wiki.laptop.org/go/Produce_Puzzle](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Produce_Puzzle
), and am now working on porting that over as another proof of concept. This
is what I'll be spending the next 6 or so work days on.
