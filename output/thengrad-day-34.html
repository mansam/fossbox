</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I was working on my custom recipe creator for most of the morning and
afternoon. What I had left to work on was proving to take much longer that I
thought it would. I'm not really running into problems working on it but every
time I go to do something I realize that I would have to do three things
before that to make it work which created an almost fractal like pattern to
the work I had to do to get my idea to work. Then Jenneh, her irc nic not her
real name, asked me to stop by and help her go over everything for her trip to
Washington D.C.. When I got back I realized the day was almost over and I had
promised DAWacker that I would have the fixes to events so that he could run
stable versions of the different stands finished by the end of today so I put
the recipe on hold, might work on that over the weekend, and quickly finished
that.</p>
