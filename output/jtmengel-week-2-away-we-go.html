</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week was a good run, resulting in a functional test application for
animations under controlled processor loads which I fine-tuned over the
weekend. We have been seeing BMPs come out ahead so far in terms of speedy
load times, so we expect to be working on scalability with those and, if we
can discover some way to implement them, SVGs as well. We'll see what the week
had in store for us.</p>
<p>Also, this blog feels like the Real World or some other reality TV show that
convinced me to ritualistically destroy my TV set in a blaze of fire and jello
(my gods are very particular).</p>
<p>This Monday was looking pretty good; the art team completed the test program
to compare file types, we'd begun testing and Indian food miraculously
appeared around lunch.</p>
<p>Then the exile happened.</p>
<p>It came from nowhere. We were working and suddenly, a whirlwind of activity
and confusion. Workstations relocated, productivity halted and babies crying;
it only took 10 minutes and it was over and the whole team found itself in a
small adjacent meeting room without AC, speakers or ... well that's it (but
that's a hard life).</p>
<p>It might be the heat speaking but I'm starting to think that we're on the path
of glory; we have moved from the meeting room in the Innovation Center, into
the open meeting room, to a smaller meeting room, so in passing it may seem
that we've lost out, but I sense a deeper meaning to it all: In one short
week, we've managed to close the distance between our workspace and the dean's
office in the Golisano College of Computer and Information Sciences.</p>
<p>I'm going to pencil this into the calendar: "Week 4, Establish
workspace/control in GCCIS Dean's Office"</p>
<p>...and "Week 9, President's Office".</p>
