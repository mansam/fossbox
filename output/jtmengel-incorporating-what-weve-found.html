</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In these last two weeks, Dave and I on the front end team have made progress
on outlining what we want to implement and, more importantly, what we will
leave out to streamline performance; We've been bouncing between two phases of
our design process, the first being fervently adding features and
functionality and the second being aggressively purging what isn't absolutely
necessary. After the heart-wrenching experience of going through that process
more than a few times, saying goodbye to code written with my hands until my
typing fingers were worn down to the bone and were reduced to little more than
withered claws, we walked away from the design process as heroes - only to be
faced with the implementation of our new Drawable and Dynamic Drawable Objects
into the game engine.</p>
<p>In more specific news, Dave has been excellently laboring on the code for the
Drawable Objects while I did some additional reading up on efficiently
looping, iterating etc in Python (if any of my fine readers have any advice,
I'd love to hear it!) and polishing up the master test file and including a
section on rotation therein.</p>
<p>In our near future: Implementation. We've branched off of Jlew's git
repository with a working version of his game engine, and now we will take the
steps to put these objects into the game engine (and hopefully it's not as
labor intensive as I anticipate)</p>
<p>Also, I would end this with "Cheers", but apparently "Cheers" is slang for
"thanks" in Britain? Either that, or I'm working with bad information / my
European friends are trying to break into my mind.</p>

add, but when there is nothing left to take away. -Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry</p>
