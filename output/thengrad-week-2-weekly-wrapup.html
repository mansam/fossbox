</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It is now the end of the second week. I’m tired of having to constantly deal
with these technical problems. They are seriously becoming a problem.
Hopefully I’ve seen the end of them or else I’ll be nothing but dead weight to
team Lemonade Stand. This week team Lemonade Stand was working on planning out
the project for the summer. We have an idea about what we want to do. The
problem, though, is that to do the open badges there was a lot that we had to
learn about the school servers and how the XOs communicate with the school
servers. This turned out to be a large maze full of misdirection that led to a
lot of not very helpful information. Eventually we met some very helpful
people on an irc channel for the sugar school servers. They provided us with
some very helpful information. Since Friday was Lemonade day at an elementary
school, team Lemonade Stand got permission to use that event to do some
preliminary play testing done on Lemonade Stand. We also spent some of this
week learning how to use git and vim. The plans for next week are to actually
get started on working on the code for Lemonade Stand. Even though there are a
few things we don’t fully understand how things work between the XOs and the
school servers, we have to get started or we won’t have enough time. So we are
going to split into groups and start working on the different parts so that
even though some of us might still be researching the school servers we can
still get some progress made.</p>
