</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Sadly today we packed up the FOSSbox :( We are preparing to move to a
different location for the remainder of the summer as the Innovation Center
will be renovated for new work space and the FOSSbox 3.0.</p>
<p>Most of the day was packing up computer components, posters, and a whole lot
of books. My task was organizing books with my buddy Ryan and packing and
labeling boxes accordingly.</p>
<p>Since it was Thursday, it was also Buffalo Wild Wings Day! For those who don't
know what this is, it is a special that Buffalo Wild Wings has on Thursdays
where boneless chicken wings are 65 cents each! This was an awesome reward
after moving and packing up everything.</p>
<p>I was also successful at completing my config file for irssi and being able to
auto connect to irc.freenode.net as well as auto joining the #rit-foss
channel! My group and I also figured out a wish list for Lemonade Stand and
prioritized the list according to what is essential, what would be nice, and a
wish list of features we would like to add if time permits in this cycle of
development. There is a diagram of how the game worked before and a wish list
of the last cycle here <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade Stand
Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I will be working on a new diagram later and show how we will be incorporating
Open Badges into Lemonade Stand as well as any new features we agree on
implementing. Overall very successful day!</p>
