</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So I've been spending some time finally getting some time to familiarize
myself with CIVX and all the parts that make up the system. I'm almost
comfortable with how the whole thing works together, though I'm not entirely
clear on how some things work to finally get to the screen.</p>
<p>Still, I got things running, both the current CIVX build and Kayeight's
widget, though getting the two together is harder than it seems like it should
be. On the other hand, I tweaked the GettingStarted page of the CIVX wiki to
smooth out a few bumps I ran into during the install process. The Ubuntu
instructions are still broken, but I plan going to look into that in the
future.</p>
<p>In terms of actually getting things done, I haven't done much of substance.
I've been immersing myself in CIVX, git, pep8, and all the different things
that go into the FOSS BOX. While I've been in the open source community for a
while now (and my very first project is almost 1.5 years old), I've never
really tried to insert myself into a project that was running in full swing
with established work. Somehow this seems different than the places I've
worked previously... though that could simply be the distributed nature of the
work. With Luke no longer down the hall somewhere, getting information has
turned into a more interesting experience when the necessary parts are in his
head.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to an exciting next few weeks here, and a fruitful next
few years with the information learned from this experience.</p>
