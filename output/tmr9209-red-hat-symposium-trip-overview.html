</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The trip this weekend was totally a blast. It was really cool to go and
present in Boston at Red Hat headquarters. The presentation went very well
there, in which the team came together in the last couple of minutes to
telecast after having network difficulties. This and our preparation from the
week before allowed us to nail the presentation to the Symposium back at RIT.
We were also able to present to Red Hat directly and hear a little bit about
what they do. This was pretty cool since I got to learn more about open source
stuff and was able to get feedback on our game.</p>
<p>We also did a lot of other activities on the trip in our free time. Spot, the
leader of the Red Hat team, paid for our dinner and meals several times which
was really amazing. He also told us about the the pinball arcade housing over
130 pinball machines. At the arcade I had a blast playing pinball, air hockey,
and pool. Finally, before heading back we went to the MIT museum which had a
lot of technological devices, information, and knowledge.</p>
