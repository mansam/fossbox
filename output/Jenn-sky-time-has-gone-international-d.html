                    <p>Good stuff is happening!</p>
<p>Thanks to the wonderful David Wilson, Sky Time is now translated into 4
different languages: English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. I made a new
language screen for Sky Time, and I am revising some screens for Lemonade
Stand.</p>
<p>I had the very important duty of picking up our huge Buffalo Wild Wings order
with Suzanne, which may have included a stop to 7-11 for a free icee. :D</p>
<p>Travel plans were made for me to go to DC. Visiting the White House will be a
pretty intense experience, not to mention knowing that I am representing
FOSS@RIT. I better be on my game! I can be great in situations like that if I
am in the right state of mind, but starting conversations with new people can
be difficult. Once it begins I am perfectly charming. It is just taking the
leap to introduce myself.</p>
<p>I have a friend who I haven’t seen in a long while who’s living in DC this
summer. I am rather excited to see her, not to mention that I will actually
have someone to have dinners with. I am all for traveling alone, visiting San
Francisco for GDC was the highlight of my year, however lonely meals kinda
suck. I kept ordering too much food and daydreaming about if I only had
someone to share it with. While in California I had my first banana split, a
ten dollar ice cream. Halfway through the bowl I was forcing myself to finish
it on principle. I was nauseous and shivering by the end. Some perfectly
delicious spinach paneer also went to waste. (I know, I have a real tough life
:p)</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to work related things:</p>
<p>Making screens for Sky Time where the backgrounds did not jump as the screens
switched was more difficult than expected. I picked up some tricks on how to
do this well in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Instead of copying the background and trying to place it in the same place on
another canvas, go into canvas selection mode and simply alt-drag the canvas
with the original background. Do this with whatever shapes you do not want to
move from screen to screen. You will never be able to place these perfectly by
eye, so it is much better, not to mention easier, to let to computer do this
for you. I do not believe you can copy and paste canvases, but alt-click does
the job.</p>
<p>I had all intentions of working on the Sky Time website today. (
<a href="http://www.playskytime.com">www.playskytime.com</a> ) I made some minor tweaks
but I think it may be interesting to have a page with our story/ History on
it. I already have it written up, however I am torn about if this is a good
idea or not. I would also like to add a news page with links to all the media
attention we are starting to get, and a list of places Sky Time has attended.</p>
<p>I realized I have not shared the latest Fedora badges I created. I have most
of the 10 Bulls images done as well as tagging, packaging, koji, etc. I
attached an image.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
