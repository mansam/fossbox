</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Lately we have been trying to both put a swanky new theme on the CIVX website
as well as wrap up the person dashboard. While Rebecca has been doing an
amazing job on the former, I have been working on the latter. I ran into a few
snags earlier last week when I experienced the results of not pulling from the
repository often enough (note to self: don't do that again) and had problems
merging my code with the large amount that had been committed since I last
pulled.</p>
<p>With that lesson learned, I got back to trying to get all the tabs
dynamically. With bills and actions working properly, my next target is
contact information. I was able to scrape most of the senator's addresses
using the world's most hideous regular expression and BeautifulSoup. That's
about when I hit another issue, in that the NY senate's website HTML is so
inconsistent that not even a 300 character regex could capture every senator's
info.</p>
<p>The ideal solution to this is an improvement to the Open Legislation API so
using BeautifulSoup isn't necessary, and I've submitted a request, but for now
this is the best I can manage. This week I will hopefully find a workaround to
save me from having to pull an ever greater regex hack.</p>
