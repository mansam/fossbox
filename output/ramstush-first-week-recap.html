</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This first week was quite a whirlwind of new experiences. We began by
reformating our laptops with fedora (linux), to provide an identical, team
wide developement platform. Our aim was to make collaborating alot easier as
the project continued. I was the only one who had a Macbook to reformat, and
posted entirely on this point in an earlier blog (see blog list for url to the
tutorial I used). After all that was said and done, I picked up a couple cool
features from the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/#">Gnome Shell Extensions </a>
site to beef up my work space. I added a few features here and there to make
life a little easier in understanding how to use fedora with Gnome. We were
introduced to <a href="http://piratepad.net/front-page/">PiratePad</a>, which is a
collaborative note pad for team organization in tasks. We also started
preparing for the National Civic Day of Hacking
<a href="http://hackforchange.org/">NCDH</a> which is the first holiday for hackers, that
was nationally recognised by the White House. Last semester at RIT, a team of
students, including myself, worked on an educational game called
<a href="http://playskytime.com/">Skytime</a> for deployment into the Sugar Labs, OLPC,
XO laptops. We had previously got it working, but for some reason it had some
shotty performance issues when we put it on the acutal XO laptop. During with
hackathon, three students including myself, decided to rework and update the
game so we could send a proper version to a school in North Carolina who had
some teachers that were interested in using it. Before all of this wonderful
hacking could take place, we had to pick up and move our entire operation from
the FOSSbox, to a misc lab (now named the FOSSlab) on the second floor of the
building we were stationed in. There was alot of gear to transport, so we
rolled up our sleeves and got to work. Most of the gear was rather easy to
transport and set up because of our careful planning the previous day in
boxing, but I will vividly remember how heavy an old school arcade stand is
becuase we had the distinct pleasure to volunteer to move that thing to our
new location (it was a Street FIghter Game). We all put our blood, sweat, and
tears into moving that plywood box (literally blood, my mentor Remy cut his
finger on a sharp screw while supporting it under a low hanging ceiling). As
we moving into week 2, I believe we have some very cool lessons forthcoming
with Github and various other programs which will make this summer even more
amazing!</p>
