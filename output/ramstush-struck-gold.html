<p>This day was actually Thursday because it was when we had boneless buffalo
wings from BWW's . So to correct my timeline, last Wednesday was the rough
researching day.</p>
<p>Today we started off the day by getting briefed in to how
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">VIM</a> worked. It was a little
much to take in, as we have to learn all of he different key commands that VIM
can use.</p>
<p>Continuing from our productively lost Wednesday, I hopped into the chat rooms
that Walter suggested, and pinged the guys who were in the email. Chat rooms
were #sugar and #schoolserver. #schoolserver was like hitting a gold mine of
knowledge! A dev by the handle of Alkis (or Aklis...one of those spellings) in</p>
<h1>schoolserver was a gold mine of information. He knew everything we needed to</h1>
<p>know to get started on our work :) It was a complete flip between where we
were the day before, and the Thursday we discovered him !</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday, we were able to take part in a Lemonade Day at a local
school. We got a table, and set up some XO's with <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade
Stand</a> and
<a href="http://playskytime.com/">Skytime</a>. Along with giving out free stickers and
press on tattoo's the students really enjoyed our table as they snagged some
swag and played the games. (Thier many different types of lemonade were
delicious as well :D)</p>
<p>Next post will be a week cap, tune in for the complete run down of the most
flow-less week yet!</p>
