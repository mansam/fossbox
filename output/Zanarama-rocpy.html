</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So Tuesday was <a href="http://www.rocpy.org/">RocPy</a> and I have only just gotten
around to blogging about it. It was the first time for most of the HFOSS class
to go to RocPy and it was really neat to see so many people there! The talk
was way over my head (and over the heads of most people there, I think!) I am
always amazed just how much <a href="http://threebean.org/">Threebean (Ralph Bean)</a>
knows about Python!</p>
<p>He wasn't the speaker but he knew a lot about the talk, and even though he
learned some he also contributed to the discussion. To me, that is really the
essense of what RocPy should be. I would really like to see some more
accessable talks at each event though. Perhaps even 15 minutes about how to
begin to do something in Python.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am really glad we went and I hope that people from the HFOSS course
keep going. It was nice to be able to hang out with them outside of class.</p>
