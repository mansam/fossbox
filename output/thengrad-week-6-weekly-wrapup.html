</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It is now the end of the sixth week of this summer research program. This was
an interesting week since the Fourth of July was this Thursday. However, even
if we didn’t work every day this week, the longer hours with the guest mentor
made the week even more productive. I had a busy week working on different
features in the game. I was planning on working on the badges this week but I
didn’t discuss with the group as a whole to see were everyone was and what
were the idea for badges we were all going to use was. So after putting a
small in game menu to select a different recipe in game I switched to working
on setting up the game to use more ingredients easier without always breaking.
I was going to work on more features but I ran into a long chain of errors. I
eventually found the cause was that all ingredients had to be listed in all
recipes even if they weren’t being used in that recipe. I found that
frustrating so I created a feature branch with changes that will add unused
ingredients to recipes in case you forget or don’t feel like listing them all.</p>
<p>Hopefully next week I could start helping by working on adding in the badges
to the game <a href="https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand">Lemonade Stand</a>.
However unless I talk with the group about this it will be unlikely so I will
probably work on other features we wanted to the game, like an option to
create a custom recipe.</p>
