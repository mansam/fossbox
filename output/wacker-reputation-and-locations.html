</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While waiting for some images to start loading in different item sets, like
hamburger and ice cream stand, I have decided to beginning implementing
reputation and locations.</p>
<p>Reputation helps influence the amount of cups of lemonade that you can sell
during a day. The algorithm before said that if it was a cloudy day, you would
sell 60% of the max amount of cups you can sell and if it was a hot day you
would sell out. This has to do with balancing the game because this allowed
players to rack up money extremely fast and not have to worry about buying
ingredients everyday. I changed this by adding in reputation that you gain
everyday by selling to every possible customer that comes to your stand. As
you gain more reputation, more people will show up to your stand. If you
sellout before the day is over and there are more customers waiting to buy,
you will lose reputation. This balances the game significantly by preventing
players from steam-rolling with money.</p>
<p>Locations add the ability for players to set up their stand at other locations
which can attract more people and sell more cups for more money. Some
locations will have a cost to rent out for the day, but will reward players
significantly.</p>
