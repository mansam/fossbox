<p>As I mentioned on day 12, we planned out when our issues would have to be
dealt with by, as well as who has to solve which issue.</p>
<p>All this can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-
stand/issues">HERE!!!!</a></p>
<p>Click on any issue to see a more detailed explanation of what it entails, or
filter by milestone to see when things are due.</p>
<p>In addition to that I have been named "Community Lead" of the project, where
as my teammates RAMstush, DAWacker, and Thengrad are Badges lead, Tech lead,
and Game lead, respectively. I hope I got those right. My job entails keeping
records of whatever happens so that future developers have explicitly detailed
stores of information to turn to about what we accomplished here; I wouldn't
anyone else to be as <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/In-the-dark.svg">in the
dark</a> as
we were.</p>
<p>Speaking of being in the dark, however, I have also been assigned to get our
processes regarding school-servers for the XOs up and running and spent all of
today reading up about them. We also got to be in on a skype call with the
leading developers of the XSCE - <a href="wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3">XO Server Community
Edition</a> - who are
responsible for the recent 0.3 release. Aside from that I got fed up about
only reading up on and hearing about the XO school servers without having one,
I will try to take things into my own hands and install one on my computer as
I work from home on day 14, our first "Work From Home Friday."</p>
<p>If the last link doesn't work, here's the
url:wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3</p>
<p>Wish me Luck!</p>
