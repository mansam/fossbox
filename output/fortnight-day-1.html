</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Greetings! Today was the second day of Summer at rit FOSS. I finally got to
install and use Sugar, the desktop environment originially developed by Sugar
labs for the XO laptops in OLPC program. I remember long ago I first heard
about them from watching 60 minutes with my dad back when I was still in high
school. Here's the url to the original article:</p>
<p><a href="http:/
/www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/20/60minutes/main2830058.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/20/60minutes/main2830058.shtml</a></p>
<p>Geez, it's already been 6 years since then. Well, that was the first time I
considered not having a computer with windows on it. I would have bought an XO
laptop then, until I noticed that I only had half the money required at the
time. they were $200 each, but to buy one you have to buy another for a child
somewhere out in the world, doubling the amount.</p>
<p>Regardless, now I have the ability and opportunity to make a difference and
develop the Sugar platform and its programs, and I wouldn't have had either
back then. I played Lemonade Stand today and killed it, making enough money
for the games negative effects to not even make a dent in my product supply. I
spoke with my teammates about possible badges and additional features to the
game, and took a long look at the code. As the only non-IGM major in our
group, I'm eager to show my expertise in the raw programming going on behind
the scenes. I wanna show just how many lemons I am worth. Link Related, it's
the opening screen from Lemonade Stand:</p>
