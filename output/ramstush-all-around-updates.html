</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Well it has been quite some time since my last blog post and there has been a
BOAT load of happenings going on in FOSSLAND. SkyTime, Lemonade Stand, are all
on their way to become solid-fantastic things!</p>
<p>SkyTime:</p>
<p>We in the SkyTime Team were recently accepted to the White House in Washington
DC because of our activity at the National Civic Hack-a-thon a couple weeks
ago. We originally planned on working with SkyTime because we weren't happy
with how it performed on the XO laptop. We needed to update the drawing
functions to allow the our North Carolina school to have an optimal beta game
to test. Little did we know that our work would send our fledgling program to
DC!! Currently, we have optimized SkyTime for the XO by removing the alpha
funcitonality, and replacing it with only pygame blit's. We also have
localized the game to include English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The
images were replaced with updated graphical backgrounds, and a score tracker
was implemented to allow the students to keep track of how well they are
doing.</p>
<p>Lemonade Stand:</p>
<p>We ran into a bit of a road bump because our school server never got off the
ground do to unforeseen circumstances. SO we rethought our strategy and
decided it would be best to decentralize the badges process and place the
badges within a separate activity entirely, but have that activity update a
webpage whenever it connects to the internet. Currently, the game creates a
datastore object and saves specific data to the object, thus creating a place
for us to begin our badges work. The Lemonade stand game as it stands has had
an almost total make over. New Screens have been added, as well as new
graphics for each screen, new themes for the stand, new localization themes
for different languages to be selling native products instead of just
lemonade. Difficulty settings, game modes, and new random events have been
added to provide more depth to the game. We believe that this will encourage
players to continue to play for the badges that will be implemented shortly.</p>
<p>Sash:</p>
<p>This is the activity that we decided on creating to display the badges, but
will also have the functionality to award the badges as well. Because of the
current excitement surround SkyTime, Sash has been placed on a back burner and
still stands as just an icon that shows up on the Sugar XO homepage. Now that
SkyTime has been shipped out, we plan on bring some heat to the Sash to start
coding in some badge and display functionality this week to further our
milestones before we need to present our summer research findings.</p>
<p>That's the most current updates we have so far, nothing too much in searching
and usability in this blog post, but we will without a doubt find more bumps
along the road to throw some sweet links and code bits here for all you devs
out there.</p>
