<p>So today I set out to install the 0.7 edition of school server on the XO
laptop that I've been messing around on. I followed <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XS_Installing_Software">these
instructions</a>. To install it
on an XO though, I would need to <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org
/go/XS_Techniques_and_Configuration#Installing_from_USB">Install it from USB.</a> I had some trouble
setting up the boot usb: The script kept saying that I needed to unmount the
drive after checking to see if it could be used. After getting quite angry at
the script I asked for help from the irc chat, and got a reply from
<a href="http://github.com/decause">FOSSmaster decause</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kgrange">kGrange</a>, who I believe is a FOSSbox alumni.
Apparently the command to unmount a drive is "umount", not "unmount", because
that makes sense. <em>grumble grumble</em> So <code>umount sdb1</code> before rerunning the
install script got the job done. Unfortunately though, the XO didn't boot up
the installer automatically and I don't know how to make it boot from the
terminal. I guess that'll just be the first thing on my gameplan for "Hackin
with <a href="https://github.com/lmacken">Lmacken</a>" on monday. I can't install it on
my tower because it thinks that it's drives are external, and I can't install
it on my laptop because it can't dual-boot; it wipes a drive before
installing.</p>
<p>In other news I also had a public speaking seminar with the McNair scholars,
and learned some valuable tips from someone who had some good chops on the
subject. I'll be talking my presentations over with FOSSmaster decause though,
who has public speaking chops, as well as sweet muttonchops. Due to the class
I'm taking with McNair, I'm going to be Research lead on the project from now
on as well.</p>
