</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today was packing day for the FOSSBox. Everything in the FOSSBox is now packed
and ready to be moved to it's new temporary location while the FOSSBox is
being renovated. After that the Lemonade Stand team worked on organizing our
ideas into what where the main things we were going to add this summer, what
were things we would like to have added by the end of the summer, and things
we would like to see added next time. After that we customized our irc
settings. While we were doing this we found a solution to a problem we were
having with auto joining channels with irssi. We made the correct
modifications to the config file but the channel wasn't opening when we ran
irssi. It turns out that irssi had multiple pages open that could be cycled
through by hitting ctrl and then the number of the page. The first page is a
status page of your current running of irssi. When you give the command /join
CHANNELNAME it automatically to the page of the channel. However if you set a
channel to auto join, irssi stays on the status page and you have to manually
switch to the joined channel.</p>
