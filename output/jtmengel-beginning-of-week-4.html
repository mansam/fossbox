                <p>
                    <p>So last week the FOSS-Box manned a booth at the RIT Symposium of Deaf
Education and Technology; we met a good number of people and showed off the
XO's as well as the software we're developing for the platforms. Most of the
questions and interest was directed at the XO's themselves, but such is life.
Last week was more or less lost to the sake of programming though, and the
work that I managed to sneak in between questions was largely focused on
getting the master test program on its feet. Thursday, after the symposium,
was excellent since we managed to get down into the vaults at the
International Museum of Play in Rochester, looking at (but not touching,
unfortunately) their cataloged collections of videogames and other objects of
play. Very fascinating, especially when the curator (I believe) led us through
the museum floor explaining the significance of the displays as they
correlated to Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Even better was a
short visit to Second Avenue Games to discuss their workflow and design
principles when approaching educational games, which I found particularly
beneficial.</p>
<p>The application I'm currently writing is a program that will cycle through a
pre-made set of images and return a file formatted as a .csv with the results;
This is meant to act as our final testing solution, and if anyone would like
to review it, even as I am developing it, I would appreciate it greatly (it is
within our git repository, which I have only just began working with, so email
me if you're interested in taking a look at my code).</p>
<p>So far the plan this week is to have everything done by tomorrow, so this week
will have to be a high productivity week to off-set the awesome, but slow
working, week we had last week.</p>
<p>To work!</p>
