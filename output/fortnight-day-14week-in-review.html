</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>WOOOO!!!! This was our first full week at FOSSbox, exciting stuff!! Here's a
recap of what I've done:</p>
<h2>Day 10:</h2>
<p>-&gt; Days got mixed up, monday's entry was added into last <a href="http://foss.rit.edu/node/481">week's week in review post</a></p>
<h2>Day 11:</h2>
<p>Marking Milestones</p>
<p>-&gt; Issues on <a href="https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-stand/issues">GitHub</a><br />
--&gt;&gt; I transferred over our list of "Core Requirements" and"Would be Nice-ties"<br />
--&gt;&gt; I also added in issues about or project with badges, adding info the XO Journals, and researching and implementing school servers<br />
-&gt; TIL how to plan out projects on GitHub, and work on parts in separate branches</p>
<h2>Day 12:</h2>
<p>Assignments and Ouya</p>
<p>-&gt; Today we actually organized our issues on <a href="https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-stand/issues">GitHub</a><br />
--&gt;&gt; We organized our issues into three trimesters<br />
--&gt;&gt; We allotted the issues from the first trimester out<br />
-&gt; We discussed changes to the UI of Lemonade-Stand<br />
-&gt; We also got to playtest the <a href="http://www.ouya.tv/"> OUYA android gaming system</a><br />
-&gt; TIL Kickstarter funds many incredible projects, funding them will get you cool things for cheap!</p>
<h2>Day 13:</h2>
<p>School Server Problems</p>
<p>-&gt; In addition to our allotment of work on GIthub, we also got team roles<br />
--&gt;&gt; I'll be Community Lead - in charge of keeping good records of what we do<br />
--&gt;&gt; Other jobs are "Development Lead", "Tech lead" and "Game lead"<br />
-&gt; We told the developers of school servers what we plan on doing with the software<br />
-&gt; TIL It's quite frustrating to read up and try to work on something you don't physically have yet</p>
<h2>Day 14:</h2>
<p>Work From Home Friday!</p>
<p>-&gt; I rented out an XO from FOSSbox as well as an ethernet usb adapter.<br />
-&gt; My plan was to Install sugar onto my tower and make it into an XO school server<br />
--&gt;&gt; My tower apparently thinks it's internal hard drives are external<br />
--&gt;&gt; Fedora can't be installed on external drives<br />
-&gt; My hastily created backup plan was to make my Laptop into an XO school server<br />
-&gt; I followed <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition/0.3/Installing">this</a> to the letter<br />
--&gt;&gt; My Laptop, whilst running sugar, only gave me a message saying, "Not an XO, please run 'xs-config'"<br />
--&gt;&gt; No other method calls including 'xs-config' existed, according to the terminal<br />
-&gt; I didn't want to try doing it on the XO laptop without the FOSSbox's permission<br />
-&gt; TIL Even with instructions, it's easy to bite off more than you can chew</p>
<p>P.S. I was going to add memes again, but quickmeme is down, but I'll start
making them daily as soon as it's back up! Day 14 would've had a FWP about not
getting free software to work on three different computers! <em>sigh</em></p>
