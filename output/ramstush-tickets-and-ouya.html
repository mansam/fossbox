</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today had a bunch of unexpected happenings. We began the day working on our
own this time because our mentor was busy with meetings and the such, so we
set up our own <a href="http://etherpad.org/">EtherPad</a>, which is essentially what we
do every morning with various different online text editors. This gives the
teams a place to jot down their roles for the day and allow us that amazing
feeling of literally crossing a task off of your list of todo's. We then took
a specific ticket that needed a little more definition in it's description and
ironed it out for about two hours. It took us this long because the UI of
Lemonade Stand as it stands is a little confusing to young students, and we
want to make this as effective as possible without having to explain the
entire game to the students who want to play it. We mocked up a new UI, with
different visual feedback that remains effective when we switch the screen
coloration to it's anti-glare filter. New art backgrounds were outlined for
the "making-change" mini-game to allow easier communication of what needed to
be completed. Once we settled on who had which tickets, a magical, wonderful
development tool arrived at the FOSSbox.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ouya.tv/">OUYA</a> is console system that runs on Android. A
fellow student had already donated to the
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> campaign, resulting in getting his
OUYA plus a controller earlier than the rest of the world. We play tested a
couple games on the OUYA including God of Blades, Polarity, Flashout 3D,
Garnatron, and Monacle Man. Most of our games were free because you have to
purchase the full version from the online store, but they were impressive none
the less. The most attractive thing about this console for me personally, is
that there are only 145 games out there for this console which leaves tons of
space for developers to jump aboard and start making some sweet games!
Personally, I am considering getting an OUYA because the allure of learning
how to develop for android is too much to disregard, and with all the hassle
floating around Microsoft's Xbox-One and Sony's PlayStation 4 makes me want to
leave those companies in my past.</p>
