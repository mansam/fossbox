</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Our group was unable to attend the PlayTesting session because we all had
class. However, this is just as well because our project isn't something that
would be very fun for kids to play, especially 4th graders. Our target is
closer to Kindergarten students who are learning about weather. Right now, you
can just enter the weather, and possibly log it.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/g.rit.edu/presentation/d/1cHYouvN
lDTrJ8BkXhyrfwBDlABlG_TQUa0EnLZG0U9I/edit#slide=id.g25e89f3e6_011">Our presentation</a> looks
pretty nice though. Our plan for the presentation is just to have each person
chime into what they contributed for each slide. Some slides we may not all
speak, but this way we will all get an opportunity to contribute.</p>
<p>Our project isn't everything we wanted it to be, but it isn't a terrible
project. All of our logging and buttons are working. As of right now, writing
to the journal isn't working. We are not entirely sure about why the file will
not right, but hopefully we will figure that out before the presentation. I am
happy that the Journal code is at least in place so that it could be
implemented by future developers. I may even try to keep working on it while
on co-op. I will probably have extra time, and I will be learning about
sensors at my co-op which may help me with the XO sensors.</p>
