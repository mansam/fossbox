</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So I spent the day finishing up all the merging to add in the code I created
for the new ingredients and custom recipes. I also was present for the sugar
meeting. I would have said something while I was there about the new sash
activity we are creating in order to view and store Mozilla Open Badges on the
XO while my the member of team Lemonade Stand who was supposed to talk about
it was preoccupied. However, since I haven't worked on it myself I don't now
much more about it than that it exists. I've finished merging my code with the
latest version of develop but I ran into a problem with the gettext is being
used and thus haven't been able to figure out if my changes are compatible
with the latest version of Lemonade Stand so I haven't uploaded my current
version of develop to the github repository yet. I'm going to ask the members
who worked on translation about this on Monday so I can quickly close my
ticket and devote full time to the presentation.</p>
