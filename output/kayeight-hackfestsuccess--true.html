</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As you may have read, this past week the entire FOSS-box roadtripped to Boston
for a hackfest at OLPC headquarters. Though we don't work on the XO laptops,
CIVX was also able to tag along, and it's a good thing we did - the
opportunity to work in person with Luke again was invaluable. It's awesome
what can get done over the course of eight hours in a conference room with a
bunch of hacker extraordinaires!</p>
<p>I made a lot of progress with the person dashboard widget while in Boston. The
headshot scraper I wrote finally works properly, and I was able to conjure
some more BeautifulSoup magic to scrape senators' district and social media
information from the Open Legislation site (with much thanks to Luke for
actually implementing my code in the widget). The whole thing is starting to
take its final shape now that it is moderately usable.</p>
<p>Our next step is implementing the calendar that currently exists as a non-
functional tab in the person dashboard. I've had some issues with the senate's
calendar feed having incorrect timestamps for start times, and submitted a bug
report on their website. Once that is solved there's still the issue of
getting only events specific to a certain person.</p>
<p>Looking forward to another productive week, and the completion of the person
dashboard at last!</p>
