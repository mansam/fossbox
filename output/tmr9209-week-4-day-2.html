</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The team just got out of the development meeting to get our ideas flowing and
get a concept for our game created. I am very pleased what we accomplished,
there was a lot that we discussed and brainstormed. One of the major
components brainstormed was how the world would be based on the databases,
bugs, and various fedora community components. A database or section of code
could be various regions of land. For example, the python land would be a
large section of the world and map. A bug would become a dungeon and would
spawn enemies. In this way the world that people would interact in would be
based on the community and the projects that were in development at the time.</p>
<p>The other major component discussed included how the economy would work. Using
our land system concept above, each region could have property that valued
based on that region. A region could grow or digress and property could go up
or down. By cooperating effectively a community could advance their own areas
of the world. In addition to this, we thought about how monsters and boosts
would provide materials. Certain regions would only contain certain materials,
fostering cooperation and trade. It would also effect the value of items since
larger regions would have more items available.</p>
<p>These ideas that we threw around were essential to progress our project
forward. I believe these concepts could be the start to making our game
innovative and successful. We were not looking at implementation yet, but the
concept itself seems feasible.</p>
