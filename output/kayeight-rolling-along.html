</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The past week has been very busy with conferences and meetings, but I still
managed to get some quality stuff done. I learned how to actually make a
widget in TurboGears, as opposed to the somewhat brute force way I have been
doing things, so hopefully soon the mess that is my tabs demo will be looking
much cleaner. I've added a couple interesting bits of jQuery, including the
HeatColor widget Rebecca posted about earlier. I also found a <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/">much more
versatile calendar</a> to replace the jQuery UI
one - this one will be easier to play with to add our own images, tooltip
events, etc. It also plays nice with JSON feeds, and I have been trying to
feed in some of the NY senate feeds to test it out.</p>
<p>Another neat widget I discovered is <a href="http://www.sanisoft.com/blog/2009/01/23/img-notes-v02-a-couple-of-bug-
fixes-and-some-more/">Img
Notes</a>, a Flickr-like utility that lets you add notes to
pictures. Rebecca and I have been working on this for eVanhee. It was such a
lucky find, since in our recent meeting there was expressed interest in being
able to "tag" important parts of eVanhee's images. Right now we are trying it
out on a simple house drawing but it has a lot of potential, especially since
notes can include HTML (i.e., can be blinged out).</p>
<p>Today we've been hanging out at the NTID Tech Symposium. The plan for this
week is to finish up the person widget dashboard and configure it so that it
can take a name and get all the relevant information from senate APIs. I'm
looking forward to getting cranking on the calendar, my personal favorite
component. So exciting to think about all of this going live soon!</p>
