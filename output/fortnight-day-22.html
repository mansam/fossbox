<p>Today I messed around with the
<a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Holt/XS_Community_Edition">XSCE</a> a bit more. I
had been taking notes on different functions for a while now, but after
understanding the main functions I realized the answers I were looking for
weren't in there. I was only seeing how it was supposed to work, and being sad
when it didn't. Unfortunately I had bit off more than I could chew with this
task. Perhaps the reason I agreed to solve the school server problem was
because I wanted to solve a difficult problem by myself. Being the only
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/">Computer Scientist</a> on the team, I wanted to prove
myself as being multifaceted; the other students are <a href="http://games.rit.edu/">Game
Designers</a> or <a href="http://games.rit.edu/node/142">New Media
Development</a> majors. I wanted to solve the
issues with the network and save the day so we all stop worrying about how the
gap between the game <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade
Stand</a> and the system of
<a href="http://openbadges.org/about/">Mozilla's Open Badges</a> will mesh together in a
brilliant dance of hacking harmony.</p>
<p>If I wanted to have a server that worked I shouldn't have just looked at how
it's parts worked together, I should've corrected the way the network worked
to adapt to our systems.</p>
