</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Yesterday was crazy....between losing power and a freak hail/thunderstorm
which turned my car seats into sponges, getting things done was difficult.</p>
<p>We came into work with a beautiful day above our heads and a readiness to
tackle the day. I started the day by digging into the activity I found over
the weekend as well as tearing apart the code for the mock journal
application. A similarity i noticed strait off was that bot acvities mentioned
"logging" as in the standard library. I didn't know what logging was so I
added it to the SkyTime activity in hopes that it would magically work, but
only to find out that logging is a debug tool that allows the activity to log
the errors that happen for future reference. I found this information at
<a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Python_Standard_Logging_in_Sugar">Python Standard Logging in
Sugar</a>. Needless
to say the logging implementation didn't work, and it was about that time that
the power went out. Without power, some of the team could still access the
internet but most of the team would run out of battery life within an hour
which made working rather silly. while this outage was happening, a
thunder/hail storm hit and I had to sprint to my car to close the cracked
windows. I was 4 mins late, and got to sit in soaked seats for a drive home to
get a new change of clothes. We disbanded after 4pm to cut our losses and came
to work a little later on Tuesday because we are going to a Rochester Python
meetup later tonight.</p>
