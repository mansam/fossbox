<p>I redesigned the character for lemonade stand. I did not think the previous
character was transferrable enough for players across the world. So I gave him
a lemon head. That may have been a strange solution, but I thought it would be
better to take race and gender out of the equation. Also having a lemon for a
head is kind of funny! However, I am a bit worried I am designing this for too
young an audience. Maybe lemonheads are cool in third grade, but once fourth
grade rolls around the students think it is sooo last year.</p>
<p>I made some small cursors as well. One is a lemon slice, the other is a cup of
lemonade. I think that was a great design decision Lemonade Stand Team! Cool
stuff.</p>
<p>I also created a few Fedora badges that you can earn by being in a #Fedora IRC
channel. We really need to consider the naming conventions for these badges,
their names are currently a mess. Very hard to tell what is what in that repo.
(My Fault I named them) Just something to reconsider!</p>
<p>Took a bunch of pictures at my brothers pre-prom. :D He is all old and stuff!</p>
