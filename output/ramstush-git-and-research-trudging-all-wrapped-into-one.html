</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last tuesday, the main achievement of the day was getting a GitHUB tutorial
from one of our mentors. It was an extremely cool seminar where I believe
everyone learn alot more than they thought was possible. Also, merging a text
file from at least 7 people who were asked to change one line is a rather
tedious task. I had the unfortunate pleasure of merging the same file at least
5 times....We were also linked to a <a href="http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png">Git Resource
Sheet</a>. This will
be mighty handy!</p>
<p>ON TO RESEARCHING THE INTERWEBS!</p>
<p>Yesterday was perhaps the more exhausting day we have had so far. We needed to
find out how sugar labs school servers talk to XO laptops so we can begin
actually developing our code. Most of the day we spent mining the internet and
finding nothing but high level descriptions of "what sugar servers are, what
they do, and how they work." It wasn't helpful at all in actually finding the
code that makes the talking happen. One of our teammates went into the sugar
files that we all have installed on our boxen, and dug through each and every
file trying to find something that would be helpful. To no avail, I ended up
obtaining the Sugar Labs CEO's email and asked him where we should go from
where we were. He simply replied that we should ask in channel certain devs
that might have had thier hands in how school servers work.</p>
<p>This brings us to the here and now, the sugar IRC is on the plate to be mined,
and we're finally ready to start getting on with our project because we have
something to start working on. Correction, we have a "place" to start working
from. Best of luck.</p>
