</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This concludes our third week working with FOSS@RIT for our summer Co-op. It
was a week of mostly planning and course laying for the rest of our summer. We
exploited Github and it's wonderful ticket feature to add milestones and
tickets for our goals. Since we now have our goals clearly outlined on Github,
we can finally get to work on the purpose of our summer Co-op. These tickets
are an open feature and I thoroughly encourage you all to create some of your
own when to start working on a project because it really streamlines the
workflow. Everyone knows what they are to be working on, and you have small
meetings to make sure that you're keeping up with your end. Here's the link to
learn how to set up <a href="https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/wp-e-commerce/wiki/Creating-issue-
tickets">GIThub Issue
Tickets</a>.</p>
<p>Moving onto the next big step this week, we signed up to Mozilla persona to be
able to access Mozilla Open Badges and obtain the actual purpose of our Co-op
this summer. You can get your own Mozilla persona account <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">
Here</a>. Simply supply your email address
and a password and you're all set but the cool part comes when you get yours
first badge. Once you have your Mozilla persona account set up, get your
<a href="http://openbadges.org/earn/">First Badge</a>. Once here navigate to the center
of the screen and take the badges 101 quiz to obtain your first badge and set
up your backpack.</p>
<p>Finally, probably the most exciting day this week was when another student who
is working under the Google Summer of Code sponsorship bought in an OUYA. An
OUYA is the Android Gaming console and can be found
<a href="http://www.ouya.tv/">Here</a>. We play-tested a number of games that you can
find under the game tabs on the afore mentioned website. You can browse the
games and check it out for yourself at the <a href="http://www.ouya.tv/games/">OUYA
Games</a>. This was a welcome break where we were able
to find some sweet ideas from play-testing. That's mostly it for the week,
other than a work from home friday that was mostly productively lost again,
I'm commiting this week to fixing up the journal and activities so they play
nice together.</p>
