</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It is now the end of the first week. This first week was mostly spent getting
everyone settled into the FOSS community and introducing us all into what we
will be working on for the summer. The first day, Day 0, the mentors explained
to us what IRC was, we set up Github accounts, and the mentors went over how
the summer undergraduate research was going to work. The second day, we
started looking at the projects everyone was going to be working on for the
summer, I tried to switch my operating system over to fedora but Grub2 didn't
install properly so my productivity for that was next to nothing while I was
working with two of the mentors who where there that day that had a lot of
experience with Linux trying to get the newly installed Fedora to boot past
the option to go into bios. The third day was spent packing and afterwards, to
make up for my lack of productivity the day before I went through the notes
everyone compiled after play testing Lemonade Stand and put them in a
spreadsheet and started categorizing them into will do, like to do, and to do
next time. Also I modified the config files for my IRC program irssi and
discovered something that wasn't very clear that autojoin did, check out Day 2
for more details. The fourth day was moving day and after that team Lemonade
Stand went over our list of will do, like to do and to do next time with one
of our mentors. This weekend I attended the National Day of Civic Hacking at
RIT, where I worked on one of my personal open source projects, Sky Time, see
<a href="http://www.playskytime.com">http://www.playskytime.com</a>, an education game
about analog clocks for the XO laptops. The agenda for next week will be to
plan out what team Lemonade Stand will be working on and decide on what the
milestones we will be working towards be. This was a good and I really look
forward to all the interesting things I'll be working on for the summer.</p>
