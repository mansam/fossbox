</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It is now the end of the third week of this summer research program. Team
Lemonade Stand is now ready to start working on our different assignments in
parallel. This week we had finished deciding on what our different tickets are
going to be and what the milestones for them are going to be. We then split up
the tickets for the first milestone between each of us. The ticket I got for
this milestone happens to overlap with DAWacker’s milestone and the work he
had been doing for the last few weeks. This means that even though the group
as a whole is working in parallel, the two of us will be collaborating a lot
on our tickets. I’m in charge of cleaning up the logs displayed to the user to
make them a less frightening wall of text, and I have designed some changes on
how to display these logs to make them easier to understand. There are still a
few changes that can be made to clean it up even further still and that will
be something I will be working on during the week coming up since the
milestone for this ticket is still a week away. However it is really close to
being finished so another thing I will probably be doing is choosing tickets
for the next milestone to be working on or assisting with the others in
working on their current milestones. One thing I had helped assist on this
week was the a submission video for Sky Time as the project that I worked on
during the National Day of Civic Hacking since there is a chance that the
project could earn a trip to the White House.</p>
