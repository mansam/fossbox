pleased to announce that a student-led project entitled “Sky Time” has been
selected for inclusion in the White House Champions of Change event on July
23rd in Washington, D.C. SkyTime is an educational game for the <a href="http://sugarlabs.org">Sugar Desktop
Environment</a> running on the XO laptop of the <a href="http://laptop.org">One Laptop
Per Child (OLPC)</a> initiative. The event celebrates the best
projects to emerge from the nationwide Hack for Change event that was part of
the National Day of Civic Hacking. In particular, the Champions of Change
program will highlight <em>“…extraordinary leaders in transformative civic
hacking and civic engagement”</em> and we are thrilled that RIT students have been
chosen to be included in this event. More information on the Champions of
Change program is available at
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions">http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions</a>.</p>
<p>The student team members responsible for "Sky Time" are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jennifer Kotler, Major in Biomedical Illustration, CIAS*</li>
<li>Ryan Stush, New Media Interactive Development, GCCIS</li>
<li>David Wilson, Game Design and Development, GCCIS</li>
<li>Ian Furry, Game Design and Development, GCCIS</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(*Jennifer is the team lead and will be representing the team in Washington,
D.C.)</em></p>
<p>“Sky Time” began as a class project in a course on Humanitarian Free and Open
Source Software offered through the RIT School of Interactive Games and Media,
designed by Professor Stephen Jacobs and taught by Justin Sherrill. From
there, it was refined during the Rochester Hack for Change Hackathon, an event
hosted by the RIT MAGIC Center and orchestrated by Remy DeCausemaker, Research
Associate at the RIT Lab for Technological Literacy's FOSS@RIT initiative. The
hackathon was one of 95 events participating in the White House's National Day
of Civic Hacking June 1st-2nd.</p>
<p>Currently, all four students are working through FOSS@RIT initiative this
summer. Ryan, David and Ian are working with a fourth student on another OLPC
Game, a version of the venerable "Lemonade Stand", through the Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellows program. Jennifer is hired by FOSS@RIT as a
full-time artist/designer working on several projects, including Lemonade
Stand.</p>
<p>This concept of taking class projects, ideas, and teamwork, and extending the
work, adding polish, and focus through the MAGIC Center towards greater public
adoption and impact is exactly what we had hoped for when the MAGIC Center was
created by President Destler in February. We are immensely proud of our
students and their work, as well as the faculty and staff that supported the
efforts that enabled this activity, and look forward to their participation at
the event in Washington this summer.</p>
