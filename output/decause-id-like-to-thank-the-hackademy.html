</blockquote>
<p>This testimony via tweet was just one of hundreds of thousands of people who
made their 2012 New Year's Resolution to learn how to write code. This one
person, however, just so happens to be be NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and his
pledge helped to inspire many others to do the same.</p>
<p>In just the first <a href="https://mashable.com/2012/01/03/codeacademy-code-
year/">48 hours</a> of 2012, over 97,000 people signed up for
<a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy.com</a>'s year long introductory track for
teaching the basics of programming in Javascript and HTML/CSS. As of the time
of this post, <a href="http://codeyear.com">Codeyear.com</a> reports over 438,416 people
have enrolled to receive the weekly interactive programming lessons.</p>
<p>Codecademy even captured the imagination of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/17/code-summer-plus/">highest office in the
U.S.</a> who announced a
condensed version of Code Year called Code Summer+. As an extension of <a href="http://www.dol.gov/summerjobs/">Summer
Jobs+</a>, Code Summer+ will offer <a href="http://codeyear.com/meetups">volunteer
organized meetup groups</a> all over the country,
who will meet face-to-face and discuss the programming lessons.</p>
<p>People often approach me on and off of campus and ask "Where should I start?"
Codecademy is one of the places I usually point folks to, but it is by no
means the only place to learn. One of the <strong>best</strong> resources available online
for learning about web programming is by far and away
<a href="http://w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a>. Their interactive <a href="http://w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro">Try-it-yourself
editor</a> is a
fantastic way to start coding immediately, and to even experiment with other
pieces of code you find elsewhere on the internet.</p>
<p>For other beginner friendly approaches to learning languages outside of
Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I usually point people to many of the books listed
on <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/">Learncodethehardway.org</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zedshaw">Zed
Shaw</a> has compiled a number of very useful
guides, which are happily absent of his <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com">disdain for traditional education and
software production paradigms (NSFW)</a> for
the easily offended.</p>
<p>Take note <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23why_college">#why_college</a>'ers,
the folks taking the pledge did not mention anything about <em>going to school</em>
to learn how to program in 2012...</p>
