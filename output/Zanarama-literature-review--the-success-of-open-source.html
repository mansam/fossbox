</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So as a part of the HFOSS course we were assigned to read Chapter 3 of Steve
Weber's 'The Success of Open Source'. This is just a brief rundown of the
chapter and my thoughts.</p>
<p>Information</p>
<p>Author: Steve Weber</p>
<p>Title: The Success of Open Source, Ch. 3 What is Open Source and How Does it
Work?</p>
<p>URL: <a href="http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/books/Weber-
SuccessofOpenSource-Chap3.pdf">http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/books/Weber-
SuccessofOpenSource-...</a></p>
<p>Publish Date: 2004</p>
<p>The Gist</p>
<p>This chapter details the how open source projects are developed from
contributing to collaborating to decision making. It focused a lot on the
Linux kernel and how it developed from having just Linus Torvalds contributing
to having a large user/contributor base. The chapter also explores FOSS
software from an economic and social perspective often forgotten.</p>
<p>The Good</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Breaking gender stereotypes "The fairy tale solution would be to place a brilliant young eccentric in an isolated basement room with a computer and lots of coffee and let her write software until the point of exhaustion." (59)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The metaphors were really interesting, especially comparing looking at the process of creating Ford cars and the process of making software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn't preachy, that is, it didn't detail why you should always use FOSS things and why FOSS is better than anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The discussion of of the T-shirts for contributing to projects reminds me a lot of <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Badges</a> and the idea of motivating involvement through recognition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bad</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very long....I was not expecting it to be 40 pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some statements were absolutes about groups of people and probably overstatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assumes a base level of knowledge about subjects that can leave the reader a little lost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How accurate are the statistics about how much code is written in-house, for in-house and not sold or distributed? I would like to see how that has changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How has the voting/deciding on the code direction of a project changed? As the user/contributor case has grown, I am unsure if the voting systems discussed have gone unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often does a fork become more popular than the orgin? How often does it branch off into something else entirely?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Review</p>
<p>3/5 ***</p>
<p>This chapter provides an intesting insight into the growth and into the
development and philosophy of FOSS. Its an interesting read for those with a
general familiarity with FOSS or software development. It may be offputing to
a newcomer with no experience with the subject. The information is also a bit
outdated, and could use an update. Overall, I would recommend it, but you may
need to do some extra research on your own while reading.</p>
