</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><strong>Monday: Finishing up Menu Screens</strong><br />
-Finished navigation and functionality of the main menu screen<br />
-Finished navigation and functionality of the difficulty screen and its effects with elements within the game<br />
-Finished navigation and functionality of the tutorial screen, still needs info text</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday: New Menu UI Live</strong><br />
-Finished adding info text to each screen in the tutorial<br />
-Implemented a basic challenge mode with an end condition. The end condition is completing one summer which is currently defined as 90 days.<br />
-Began talk about implementing a badge display activity on the <a href="http://one.laptop.org/">XO Laptop</a> for all of the current user's badges</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday: Dynamic and Localized Game</strong><br />
-Met with our awesome mentor, Stephen Jacobs, and began talking about implementing a new dynamic feel to Lemonade Stand<br />
--This dynamic feel meant loading in different images for the game such as a hamburger or ice cream stand to give the game more customization and a more dynamic feel for players<br />
-Created <a href="https://github.com/FOSSRIT/lemonade-stand/issues/24">a ticket on GitHub</a> which I also assigned to myself and began on implementing a dynamic way of loading information for Lemonade Stand.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday: Reputation and Locations</strong><br />
-Began implementing reputation which a player can either gain or lose depending on how well they did on that specific day.<br />
-Reputation influences that amount of people that show up to your stand per day which also determines how many people you can sell to.<br />
-Reputation in itself helps balance the game by not allowing players to accumulate an absurd amount of money within the first few days<br />
-Locations allow users to move their stand to a different area which can also influence how many customers will show up to your stand<br />
-Locations have their own specific amount of reputation.<br />
-Locations have their own customer cap<br />
-Locations have their own amount of money that the player must spend to rent it for the day, but with a rent price comes significant rewards </p>
<p><strong>Friday: Ice Cream Stand Implemented</strong><br />
-Received images from our amazing artist <a href="http://foss.rit.edu/blog/6426">Jenn</a> which were of ingredients for creating an ice cream from our ice cream stand!<br />
-Implemented a way to dynamically load in images and text to fit for different types of stands<br />
-Successfully implemented Ice Cream stand and can easily switch back to Lemonade stand by changing a single attribute within the game</p>
