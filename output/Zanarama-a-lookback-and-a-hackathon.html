</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My first week at the FOSSBox has already been a series of new experiences and
opportunities. I am running <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> for the first
time (and loving it!), I began working on my first open source project for Red
Hat, and I attended my first (civic) hackathon.</p>
<p>For this first week a lot of time was spent setting up my laptop and the many
accounts that I needed, and registered to attend and to give a 45 minute talk
about my Gource project at <a href="http://flocktofedora.org/">Flock to Fedora</a>.
Hopefully I will be selected to speak, but no matter what I am really looking
forward to (hopefully) attending. I haven't been using Fedora on my laptop for
very long but I am becoming a huge fan and I love the open source culture. I
think attending the conference will help me meet a lot of new people and start
to become more a part of the Fedora community.</p>
<p>As a way to start contributing more to the open source community and learn
more about how projects get started, I attended my first hackathon this
weekend at RIT for the first National Day of Civic Hacking. The hackathon went
from 3pm Saturday to 3pm Sunday for a full 24 hours of hacking on projects for
the good of our community. I was able to work on an awesome project called
<a href="https://github.com/JHKennedy4/FoodDesertMapper">Food Desert Mapper</a>, created
by <a href="https://github.com/JHKennedy4">John Kennedy</a>, a very recent RIT graduate.
Food Desert Mapper is an application for crowd sourcing data on the
availability of certain food staples at stores that accept
<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap">SNAP</a> benefits in order to determine "food
deserts" or areas where obtaining these staples with SNAP benefits is
difficult or impossible. You can see live project
<a href="http://www.foodmapper.us/">here</a>, so be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>John Kennedy had already started the project during his last year at RIT, but
was kind enough to catch us up and help us contribute to the project. I mostly
worked on new styling for the markers on the map, implementing
<a href="https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers">AwesomeMarkers</a> instead
of the default CartoDB</p>
