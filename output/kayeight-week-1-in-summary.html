</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's been a good first week here at FOSS. After spending a couple days getting
everything set up with my computer (git, TurboGears, fedorahosted, etc etc), I
started working on making a demo of the kind of widgets CIVX could use to
display information, particularly for the New York state senate.</p>
<p>I've been playing around with a jQuery tabs widget that's pretty sleek
looking. After some struggling to get that working in TurboGears, I think it
looks good so far, and will be really awesome once I learn more about the
scraper APIs and can actually fill it with useful information. I also put a
basic calendar widget (more jQuery magic) in one of the tabs that will
eventually track events by senator. I made a little more progress on this
today by learning to make the calendar actually do something when a date is
selected... kind of important, I guess. ;)</p>
<p>Another bit of jQuery that I started trying out today is the "accordion" style
tabs. A version of it is already in use on the CIVX websites and I have so
say, that is one nifty effect. I made a version of my demo with accordion
instead of normal tabs, and although I think the latter is more aesthetically
pleasing, both will be very useful to this project.</p>
<p>Aside from all this, I've been spending a lot of time reading up on the
various technologies used here (I'm woefully uneducated on all the things
TurboGears is capable of), and checking out what CIVX has already done, to try
to get up to speed. I've also looked at similar sites like OpenCongress to see
what's already in place and hopefully glean some inspiration. So far this has
been quite a horizon-expanding experience, as I'm used to being purely a back-
end programmer, and I'm excited to continue on a high note next week.</p>
