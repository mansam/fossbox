<p>Today I cracked down on our project, and marked out all our milestones on
<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></p>
<p>Well, actually I first had to learn how. With some experimentation I planned
out my project just as I had had to do in the Software Engineering class I
took a year ago. To view our issues and milestones <a href="https://github.com/fossrit/lemonade-
stand/issues?direction=desc&amp;sort=created&amp;state=open">click
here!</a> A while back I mentioned
when we went through and assigned topics into such categories as "Core
requirements", "Would be nices", and "Maybe next times", a la
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Miyamoto</a>'s <a href="http://w
ww.thelivingmoon.com/43ancients/04images/Pyramid/Mayan_El_Castilo.JPG">Pyramid</a>.</p>
<p>Well, as you can see at the issues and milestones link above, we have
categorized what we deem as necessary and split up the whole project into
three two-week trimesters. This is our baby, so we felt free to call them
trimesters and make some pregnancy jokes. Here's one I know:</p>
<p>A man wakes up in the middle of the night to hear his pregnant wife screaming.
At first he is worried, because she sounds as though she's in pain, but he
ends up more confused as he notices, she's screaming "Can't", "it's", and
"we'll." The husband consoles her, helps her into the car and drives her to
the nearest hospital. While they drive she screams "Shouldn't" "isn't" and
"won't". When they get to the Hospital a doctor was available and they're
taken to a room immediately. The husband explains to the doctor what's been
going on, and the doctor in a calm voice responds, "Don't worry, this happens
all the time." The husband relaxes a bit, but then his wife shouts a loud
"T'wouldn't've!" and he worriedly asks, "Doctor, what's happening to my wife?"</p>
<p>To which the doctor calmly replies, "She's just having Contractions."</p>
