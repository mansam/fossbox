</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This game can be broken up into four acts. The first act is a little easier,
possibly to get players into the game. Most of the monsters do not have
specials and are weaker to make up for the players lacking special abilities.
However, once the player gets to the second stage the monsters pick up in
their difficulty and gain several abilities which prove a challenge for
certain character types. For example, I had a hard time with wasps which do a
lot of long range damage that is hard to avoid. Wizard characters focus on
attacks and ways to use abilities to avoid damage but have low health and
defense, which does not match well with these wasps. With the challenge these
special enemies pose, a player has to struggle to get stronger, reach the
strength required to handle the monsters, and gain the abilities required to
face them. These challenges made the hard part of the game this act. Once the
players get over this roadblock, however, they gain a lot of gold to
continuously get the latest weapons and armor to make them slightly
overpowered for act 3. Although this is true, there were also some dungeons
which spiked in difficulty, mainly around certain bosses and blue elites.
Continuing on into the fourth and final act, the player seemed to be
overpowered since it became easy to continue through the act. However, the
most challenging point was right at the end with facing bosses such as Diablo
in act 4. Finally, I think the balancing across the four difficulties was well
done. Each difficulty flowed in challenge level from one to the next and each
difficulty followed the patterns of balance above throughout each difficulty.</p>
