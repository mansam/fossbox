</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So last night I got food poisoning when I ate some sour fruit and because of
that I was not able to physically be at the Foss Box today. Despite that I was
still able to get some work done. Basically yesterday I spent the whole day
building the Scene class which was the final piece that needed to be completed
of the animation system. With the code complete I spent today running tests to
make sure things work and to make sure there was nothing I did wrong.
Obviously I did do stuff wrong at first but it has now all been fixed and the
class is fully functional. The only task now is for JT and I to get rotation
working. Hopefully this will not be that bad but who knows. Worst case
scenario we don't get it working and we have a good story for our White Paper
but I don't think it will come to that. Well I still have some work to do so I
will see you next time.</p>
