</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This week has been pretty crazy between <a href="https://github.com/lmacken">lmaken</a>
being here for some hacking, a shorten week due to the 4th of July, and lots
of traveling.</p>
<p>I have made some paper mock-ups for
<a href="https://github.com/FOSSRIT/gourciferous">Gourciferous</a> and will begin
creating some prototypes in Glade (fingers crossed nothing crashes). I may try
to attach photos of the mock-ups soon, but I don't currently have a way to do
that. The only real struggle with the GUI mock-ups is where to sort things.
Gource has a lot of functionality and it overlaps. Deciding where options
should go can be a real struggle. I took two main approaches, one mock-up has
a few tabs with lots of options, the second one has a lot of tabs with only a
few options. I am not sure which approach we will be taking right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Zanarama/AmazingTurtle">Amazing Turtle</a> has also been
enjoying some growth. While it will take a lot of work (and a lot of help)
Amazing Turtle will hopefully become a source for teachers and students to
learn to program using Turtle. A deadline goal for beta completion is August
19th. On the 19th I will have the opportunity to pitch our work to the
Technology Education Teachers at <a href="http://www.wcps.k12.md.us/">Washington County Public
Schools</a> in Maryland. I went through the school
system there myself, and it would mean a lot to me to have my work help
current students there. I am really hopeful that it will tested in some of the
schools.</p>
<p>EDIT: Attached are the paper mock-ups for the GUI. There are two different
options right now.</p>
