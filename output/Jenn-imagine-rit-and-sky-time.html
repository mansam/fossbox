</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>There have been some great things happening here in Sky-Time Land. We had the
game set up on some of the FOSS Box computers during imagine RIT, and it was a
hit with the kids!</p>
<p>Don’t trust my word, this video of one child's excitement speaks for its self:
<a href="http://jlk9713.cias.rit.edu/vid
eos/index.gif">http://jlk9713.cias.rit.edu/videos/index.gif</a></p>
<p>I have to say I was not 100% confident that the game would be fun. The concept
is based around one core mechanic. (Matching times by moving clock hands) I
know how to tell time too well for it to be enough of a challenge for me.
Luckily, for children kindergarten to first grade, it totally is! (And it will
hold the attention of kids up to fourth grade)</p>
<p>They were addicted. Parents had to continually drag their children away from
the computer. I received two separate complaints from parents because it was
an open ended game. (“It’s annoying for us to get our child to stop playing
games when there is no ending.”) I’ll take that as a compliment! :D</p>
<p>We learned a lot from watching more than 50 kids (age 3-13) play our game. We
received a lot of feedback about how to improve our game. There were a few
suggestions that got repeated over and over again which we plan to implement.</p>
<p>Our current to do list:</p>
<p>-Different types of questions to cater to age levels up to fourth grade<br />
-Press enter before you see if you got question correct<br />
-Keep score of how many questions correct (or have it out of 10)<br />
-Make win screen more exciting, add animation, confetti, sound, etc.<br />
-Create a version that runs off web browser</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in! :D</p>
