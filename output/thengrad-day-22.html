</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So DAWacker found out why the events weren't showing up after five days had
passed. It wasn't working because I was using the variable's name when
checking how many days had passed when I should have been using the property's
name. He the decided to fix it himself and in the process of fixing that he
decided to completely rewrite a helper function that I had written and was
still in the middle of testing, which prevented me from continuing working on
my ticket. So I spent the morning looking at the tickets that still needed to
be closed for <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade Stand</a>.
I've moved on to working on making it so the player can choose different
recipes for the lemonade. When DAWacker had finished his version of my helper
function I looked over it a noticed that some of the logic didn't match up
with the function I originally had made so I added a few small changes. Then I
tested it out a little.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I going to finish fixing some of the balance issues I had noticed
yesterday. Then I was going to give the new helper function a thorough testing
to see if it is fully balanced. Then I was going to implement my idea to make
recipe changeable in game which should be finished by the end of the week.</p>
