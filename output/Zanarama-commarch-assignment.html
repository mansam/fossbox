</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For the HFOSS course, we completed a Commarch assignment, basically just
investigating an open source project and learning a bit about it. My group
chose Fedora Badges, because I was familiar with it and it is an awesome
project led by people that are already close to FOSS@RIT.</p>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> Fedora Badges</p>
<p><strong>IRC Channel:</strong> #fedora-infra, #fedora-apps, #fedora-badges on freenode<br />
<strong>Code Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges">https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedbadges</a><br />
<strong>Mail list archive:</strong> <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/badges/">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/badges/</a><br />

<strong>Project Wiki:</strong> <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-badges/wiki">https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-badges/wiki</a></p>
<p>Fedora Badges or Federated Badges, as it is expanding past Fedora, is a
recognition system for participation and contribution in the Fedora community
and to encourage users to get involved in the improvement of the Fedora
Project.</p>
<p>The initial commit on the GitHub page was on August 1, 2012, but the Github
page is not the original home of the code and some of the history was lost
when it was migrated. The project is still under development and being
actively committed to with some regularity.</p>
<p>Anybody can submit a pull request to Fedora Badges. Once a patch has been
submitted it has to get a "+1" to be accepted. Basically, other contributors
to the project have to peer review any of the code added to the project to
confirm that it doesn't break anything, is a valid solution or addition, and
meets style standards.</p>
<p><a href="www.threebean.org">Ralph Bean</a> has the most commits to Fedora Badges, and a
lot of the project rests on him. Fedora Badges has really only had three
contributors, although auxilary projects like <a href="https://github.com
/fedora-infra/tahrir">Tahrir</a> have more contributors. The same core group of people
seem to contribute to them consistantly though.</p>
<p>Although Threebean is the main contributor to Fedora Badges I wouldn't say he
is a Benevolent Dictator for Life on the project, although he may be called
the lead developer. The overall style of the development of Fedora Badges is
an open democracy, not a lone crusader.</p>
<p>This spirit is what would allow Fedora Badges to continue even if threebean
was viciously mauled by a raptor. While we mourned the loss, I can only
imagine how much the Fedora community would come together to continue his
work, especially because they have good documentation. Similarly, if the top
core developers were all hit by a bus the project would still survive. It may
slow down the project, and the whole Fedora community because those involved
with Fedora Badges are pretty huge contributors to Fedora as a whole, but all
projects would continue on.</p>
<p>Tahrir is the front end of Badges, while Fedora Badges is sort of the
middleman, and Datanommer and <a href="http://www.fedmsg.com/en/latest/">Fedmsg</a> are
the backend development. Tahrir is the instance that displays badges and
users. Fedmsg is a bus that gathers all of the activity that is going on in
Fedora, that is then parsed by Datanommer and fed into FedBadges to award
activity.</p>
<p>Interest in the project has been increased, especially since its real debue at
the Flock to Fedora confrence where it was a really big hit. In my opinion, it
was the most important talk of the confrence, and certainly got the most
people talking.</p>
<p>While Fedora Badges has pretty good documentation, and a great community it
isn't the most welcoming to newcommers. The project relies on many other
projects making absorbing the whole work flow difficult. However, the
developers are very easy to reach in IRC and would be more than happy to help
others out to begin contributing. New users may also begin to help on auxilary
projects, like the badges themselves, and slowly move to make code
contributions.</p>
<p>Overall, the Fedora community is awesome and working on a project like Fedora
Badges would be great. The project has enough guidance and vision to move
forward and not become stagnant, but is not so regimented that someone
couldn't come in with a great idea and mix things up. The open community
supporting the project would make it a pleasure to work on.</p>
