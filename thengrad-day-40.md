So as I thought today didn't remotely go as planned. I spent most of the day
going through and solving any conflicts that I noticed by tracing through the
code by eye. Since I get an error because I don't have the translations on my
box I've been unable to test to find what breaks after the merge. When I asked
my group mates who worked on translations they helped me get the translation
file but it still causes a problem that they were unable to help me with. So
instead of being finished after today it looks like it will take me at least
one more day to set my ducks in a row. Then in is on to presentation land
after that.
