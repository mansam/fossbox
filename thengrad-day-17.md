The Boat sank. With that and the power outage this week so far has been an
interesting group of mechanical failures. I'm so glad that it isn't my machine
this time.

Today was a productive day for me. I spent the day working through the random
event code in Lemonade Stand. I've managed to add in a few more negative
events by going into the constants file and adding some more dictionaries to
the list. I then made the negative events decrements a percentage of the items
instead of a flat amount. Right now I'm trying to find other ways to keep it
balanced so the players still can earn a profit but don't earn a profit so
fast
